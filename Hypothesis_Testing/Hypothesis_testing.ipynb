They give twenty of their customers a 50% off coupon and an additional 20 people a 10 dollars off coupon.  After a month The Donut Fairy looked at their sales and found that the customers who had a 50% off coupon spent on average 20 dollars, and those who got the 10 dollars off coupon spent 15 dollars on average.  The Donut Fairy is now wondering how sure they can be that the difference between the average sales were a result of difference in coupon types rather than chance occurrence."
