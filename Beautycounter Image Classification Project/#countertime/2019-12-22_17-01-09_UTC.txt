“God, grant me the serenity, to accept the things I can not change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.”

When I was early in my addiction/recovery process this prayer helped me get through the most difficult times as I tried desperately to stay sober.  And now I’ve probably said this prayer 1000+ times...although I’ve been sober over 10 years now- this prayer still has power today.

For anyone that needs to hear this today. You are beautiful. You are amazing. You are MAGICAL, you are a powerful force, you can OVERCOME ANYTHING...when struggles and hardships try to take us out...remember rust the Universe/God is NEVER conspiring against you but FOR you....LIFE DOESN’T HAPPEN TO YOU BUT FOR YOU...

I’m going through a pretty big sadness/crisis in my family right now (not immediate but extended) and THIS is what I’ve taken with me this week as I’ve journeyed through so many emotions and navigated through the process of grieving.  I remembered to feel...to take time for myself...to give myself self love...to be open about how I’m feeling...and be ok with my own process. Acceptance and surrender have been a HUGE piece for me this week and throughout my journey on this planet.  It’s been the key to my own peace and joy.  The key to freedom.

I believe that God/The Universe only gives us hardships that we can handle....maybe the strongest get the toughest...and I believe the #1 goal is to help us grow stronger and to one day help hold another’s hand who may experience something similar.  Don’t forget that- you may be the answer to someone’s prayers one day.  And they’d never get the strength they’d need if it weren’t for your suffering FIRST.

The Universe and God are always conspiring in your favor...And you are a force...and can and will overcome ANYTHING. 📸 @journey.hero .⁠
