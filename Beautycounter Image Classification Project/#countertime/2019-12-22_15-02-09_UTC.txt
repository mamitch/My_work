Sometimes I don't feel as confident about my appearance as I would like.  Yes, truth.

Something I found to help boost my confidence is to take the best care of my skin that I can.  After all, as I continue to grow older, my skin will always be with me, representing me to the world everyday.  I want it to be healthy and look as good as possible, whatever my age.

Committing to a cleaner, safer skincare program has helped me so much! My skin feels plump and soft, it is no longer red and irritated looking and my sun spots have diminished.

Having fresher looking skin has  even given me the confidence to try wearing eyeshadow again!  The aging process can be a little rough and I had given up on eyeshadow.  Last night I wore the Starlight Eyeshadow palette from @beautycounter.
May I just say- I felt beautiful!

If you aren't feeling as confident as you would like, try commiting to a daily skincare routine. Investing time in your skin will raise your spirit and boost your confidence.  Yes, truth.
