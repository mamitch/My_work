Pic on the left is from October 2018. I had been using @Beautycounter for just about a month and felt like my skin was looking so much better - I took this pic because I was going out without makeup for the first time ever. Fast forward 14 months and you can see an even bigger improvement. Ditching the harsh chemicals found in most skin care products does your skin good. That and the new #Countertime line which has retinatural complex, which I think acts the exact same as retinol. Message me for details on which products will work best for your skin. We can work within your budget and start switching you slowly to cleaner, safer products. (Granted my phone was not as good in 2018 as it is now, but i think you still get the ‚Äúpicture‚Äù) üå±  #Beautycounter #cleanmakeup #nomakeup #nofilter
