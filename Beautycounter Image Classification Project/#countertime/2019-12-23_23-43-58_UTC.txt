Start each day like it’s your birthday.⭐️ ———————————————————————
Coffee, Christmas movie, worked out, hopped right back into bed & shopped “THE BIG CLEAN” Beautycounter event for make up & skincare up to 40% off. This is the perfect time to stock up on your favorite clean beauty products or send out some last minute holiday gifts!
———————————————————————
The Countertime skin care line is my absolute favorite! If retinol is a NO GO for your skin (mine is too sensitive), the Countertime Tripeptide Radiance Serum is gentle, yet still visibly increases skin firmness & elasticity. I’ve also officially switched out all my make up to Beautycounter, so if you have any questions about colors, let me know! ✨
