PRODUCT REVIEW:
.
I’ve been using the @beautycounter #CounterTime box for about a month now. It’s technically considered their “anti-aging” regiment, but I feel it has benefits for all ages. .
PROS:
.
Packaging is recyclable and products are in glass containers. So for all you earth friendly buyers, packaging is enviro-friendly. .
The products are light on the face. In the morning I put on three of the five, and after a few minutes my skin feels moisturized but not heavy with product. Goes very well under foundation. .
As always, their products are free of many chemicals that are BANNED in other countries and not here. Riddle me that. .
CONS:
.
For me, some of the products are “stinky.” Meaning they do not use fake fragrances. So if you want a product that’s going to make you smell like Mountain Wind or something, look elsewhere. I spray some lavender infused witch hazel on top and it seems to help. .
Sometimes having so many different serums/lotions to put on gets annoying. But I guess that’smore of a personal thing because I’m lazy with makeup and makeup product. .
Not going to lie it’s expensive. Over $200.00🤢 BUT I’ve had it over a month and doesn’t seem Like I’ve done a lot of damage to the overall supply. So it seems like it will last a while. .
OVERALL?
Worth it. I think of all the scrubs and different lotions I’ve spent over the year. Definitely more than $300 so there you go. And I feel I’m cheap when it comes to that stuff for the most part. .
The thing that convinced me the most was this: we all have that one pore that ALWAYS develops a lovely pimple or massive blackhead. Over time it seems to scar a bit because of how irritated it always gets. I had a few of these on my right cheek, making it look spotty. After a month, the marks are almost all gone. Don’t get me wrong these products are NOT a acne prevention regiment, but it seems to help your skin’s ability to heal overall. .
Thanks @gardner_anna for the hookup. 🤘
