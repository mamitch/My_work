🎄🎅🏼Happy Christmas Eve everyone! 🎅🏼🎄In the middle of a mean game of “Go Fish”...the perfect “starter” game for my toddlers and fun for the entire family! 🥰
⁠.⁠
It’s important to remember during my busy days working from home to plan time to spend with the kids - OR I could literally work all day long! ⁠ The holidays are always SO fun BUT I can get lost in busy work all day if I could.  Thank goodness for these times 🎄 and for family activities to keep me and my kids sane. 🥰🤷🏼‍♀️
⁠.⁠
I love games... maybe almost a bit TOO much sometimes lol! I could literally play all day! So I’m teaching my kids early how to play so one day we can play the good stuff 🤣.⁠
⁠.⁠
What are some of your favorite games to play with Toddlers AND adults? I’m always looking for more games to play during family time!  Tell me 👇🏼⁠
