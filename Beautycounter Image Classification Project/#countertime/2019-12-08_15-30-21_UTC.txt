Who wants a balanced complexion and a natural glow? Who wants a double-cleanse in one product? Who wants to restore their skin to its youthful texture?  This product answers all those questions. This is the Countertime Cleansing Oil. It is the most relaxing, wonderful-smelling cleanser I have ever tried.  I’m actually addicted to washing my face, it distresses me from the day.  You use 1 squirt on a dry face and just relax by breathing it in.  It melts your makeup off and is super gentle and always safe. Then add water from your finger tips and it forms a light foam for a double-cleanse. It’s a 2-in-1.  And hands down my absolute, favorite, Daily, skincare product!
