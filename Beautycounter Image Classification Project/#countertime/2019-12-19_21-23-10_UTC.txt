Hey FRIENDS!!! Here I am with my favourite winter weather sidekick... also known as the Supreme Cream by BeautyCounter. Not only is it supremely rich and deeply hydrating, this cream visibly firms while smoothing skin texture and minimizing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. How does this cream obtain it's magical powers you ask? Well, it happens to be loaded with natural plant retinoids. This product is amazing and like many of @beautycounter â€˜s products, this cream is EWG verified, vegan, leaping bunny approved and full of awesomeness!!! You should get some. #betterbeauty #beautycounter #plantbasedskincare #nontoxicbeauty #cleanbeauty #winterskincare #hydratedskin #skincare #countertime #beautycounterconsultant
