Have you been trying to get the “perfect” holiday photo? Let it go. Real-life is in the imperfections, the laughter, the joy, the messy bun, greasy hair, no makeup- all of it.  Capture the beautiful messy fun moments in life.  Years from now I will look at this shot and remember how I felt and the sounds of these giggles. That’s what it’s all about!⁠
