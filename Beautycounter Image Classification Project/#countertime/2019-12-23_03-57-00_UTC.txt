This past Tuesday was my 2nd anniversary of using @beautycounter and I’m thrilled to now be a consultant as well. And guess what: they’re having a sale! So much (good) change has happened in 2019. From new collections (#countertime) to more sustainable packaging (#glassnotplastic) Beautycounter has been working hard to #doevenbetter 🌎 If you’ve been wanting to try the best clean beauty brand out there: now is a great time to do so ❤️ Swipe to see highlights of the sale or shop my link in bio 😘
