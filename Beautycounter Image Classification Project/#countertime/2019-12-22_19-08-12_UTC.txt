One of the beauty rituals I've been doing for years is cleansing and moisturizing my face EVERYDAY. I am 44 years old, definitely aging(thank the God Lord above) and my skin is starting to be dry consistently.  First of all, the packaging for Countertime is pretty. Dare I say pretty n pink. The dispensing is easy and the results give me clean, moisturized, dewy skin. And I feel good knowing what I'm putting on my skin is safer. The ritual of cleaning and moisturizing my face daily makes me feel ready for the day. And here I am without any makeup just cleaned, moisturized and dewy skin. Bring on the last minute Christmas shopping. #betterbeauty #saferbeauty #me #countertime #real #prettynpink
