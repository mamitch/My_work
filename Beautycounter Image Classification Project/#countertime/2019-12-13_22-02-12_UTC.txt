Another day another five million amazon boxes. Love this if ya feel me. ❤️ Let’s be real people. You’re online shopping already. 
I know. You know it. The dog knows it. Your husband knows it. 😂

We have an awesome deal right now that ends TONIGHT people. 
Trust me guys your girl doesn’t want a heart shaped piece of jewelry. She wants something she won’t spend on herself. And I’ve got it. 
And ladies, I got the things you don’t know what to get for those hard to get for people, MIL, grandmothers, traveling cousins in early 20s we are all jel of. 😂

And bonus, by shopping with me you’re voting with your dollars for safer products AND you’re supporting a family over the CEO of amazon. He good. I literally do a happy dance. 
XO and Thank you! 
Heidi
