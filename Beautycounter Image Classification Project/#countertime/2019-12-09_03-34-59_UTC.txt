When in doubt, throw some ðŸ’„ on your POUT ðŸ’‹
â€”
I donâ€™t know about you but red ðŸ’„ makes me feel SO powerful. The color red is known to symbolize confidence, power, passion, energy + love. Somedays I need a little bit of a boost when it comes to self-worth (donâ€™t we all go through these periods?! ðŸ™ˆ) so Iâ€™m happy to have a stash of clean red lipsticks in my makeup drawer to put on when needed
â€”
I rocked this red lip when I attended a womenâ€™s event at my neighbors church this past Friday night. Iâ€™m not religious but Iâ€™m very spiritual, open minded and believe in a higher power yet I felt very nervous to attend a church related event. I even thought about canceling because I was worried that I wouldnâ€™t fit in or be able to understand any of the messages given. After some tears + a nap, I got myself together + threw on a red lip while rushing out the door. When I looked in the mirror, I felt confident in myself which helped calm my nerves before walking into the event
â€”
Well guys, turns out that everyone was so nice, I understood the messages given + a few of the women were asking about my red lips (itâ€™s @beautycounter shade Girlâ€™s Nite) ðŸ’‹ Happy to have pushed past my fears + tears to enjoy a very lovely night! â€”
So when you need a confidence boost, I highly suggest putting on a red lip + heading out that door because you may be surprised at what happens! ðŸ’‹ðŸ’‹ðŸ’‹
