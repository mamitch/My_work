The completely unfiltered glow of healthy skin

Y’all, I’m not even wearing any highlighting or illuminating products, this is the result of the tint skin foundation and the cream blush combo in hibiscus and caramel

Also in one month I turn 40, which i can thank @beautycounter for the fact that my skin is still looking 25

Skincare and sunscreen are so so important, y’all. I cannot stress enough that you are never too young to start investing and taking care of your skin. Trust me as you get older, you might feel it, but you certainly don’t want to look it

I use the #COUNTERTIME regimen and the results are obvious and speak for themselves

The COUNTERTIME collection is the ultimate solution to help reverse signs of aging and keep skin in young, youthful performance. The formulas feature plant derived Retinatural a complex of bakychiol and alpine rose, provide a safer alternative to retinol while providing similar benefits. This product is also safe for pregnant ladies and breastfeeding mamas. 
January is fast approaching. Set yourself up to G L O W in 2020. I have directly linked COUNTERTIME in my bio link and y’all these products last. I won’t need to replenish for 9 months!!!!!
