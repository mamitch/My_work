Happy Friday!! 🌴 Two more days of sun before I have to return to the icy tundra😭 ⠀
⠀
Last day (for real this time) of 20% off select Beautycounter holiday sets. ⠀
⠀
I’ve been using the Skincare Best-Sellers on repeat this trip....Charcoal Mask to help with oil from all the lovely sweat going on (I know, a good problem to have).⠀
⠀
Lotus Glow Cleansing balm stick to take everything off at the end of the day, the Overnight Resurfacing Peel to even out my skin post sun🌞⠀
⠀
The No. 1 Face Oil has been a lifesaver for dry patches and this set is all in a perfect travel-size. ⠀
⠀
