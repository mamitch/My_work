I love mom and daughter days! Hello #Makeupfree selfie. 👩‍👧She, on the other hand, has a marshmallow in her mouth! 😂⁠⠀
.⁠⠀
See my laugh lines? I actually don’t mind these babies that much! They are the only wrinkles I love - they prove I laugh and smile a lot! ⁠⠀
.⁠⠀
I also think it looks adorable on other people.  CLEARLY I’m not opposed to my awesome #reverseaging skincare line from @beautycounter.  Since using it these lovely laugh lines have faded SIGNIFICANTLY yay! 🥰The new Countertime line has a Retinatural Complex in it designed to fight the signs of aging with Bakuchiol and Swiss alpine rose....👇🏼⁠⠀
.⁠⠀
Bakuchiol is a natural Retinol! It does EVERYTHING Retinol does but without the harmful side effects.... and you can use it during the day time, while pregnant and nursing!⁠⠀
.⁠⠀
Swiss Alpine Rose is an antioxidant designed to help block and protect your skin from the harsh environment while simultaneously locking in moisture! This rose grows in the Swiss Alps in harsh environments. So yeah... it’s amazing on your face! And did I mention it smells DIVINE? ☺️⁠⠀

Remember to love the skin your in...and as you age...#agegracefully⁠⠀(link in bio)
