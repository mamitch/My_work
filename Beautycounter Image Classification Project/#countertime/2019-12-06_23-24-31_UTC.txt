MAIL DAY!! Feeling extra motivated to live the @beautycounter mission of getting safer products into the hands of everyone after this weekâ€™s events on Capitol Hill.

@greggrenfrew, our Founder and CEO, testified as an expert witness at the congressional hearing on cosmetic reform.  She reminded them that the US has not passed a major federal law governing the cosmetics industry since 1938 (81 YEARS)!! During this hearing, congress also learned something that most of us donâ€™t realize; the FDA currently has no control/authority over the personal care industry.  There are only 11 products in the US that are banned from use in formulations.  11!!! To put that in perspective, Europe has banned 1500 and Canada 600.

Beautycounterâ€™s #NeverList includes over 1500 (and counting) ingredients that are NEVER used in product formulation.  Itâ€™s honestly like baking a chocolate cake without using butter, sugar, flour, milk, eggs, or chocolate.  And yet they still manage to create high performing skincare, personal care, and makeup products.  They also believe in transparency and include ingredient lists for every single product on the website.

Every single one of us 50,000 consultants are working hard to make this the industry norm instead of the exception.  Beautycounter has proven you can omit these harmful ingredients and still make a high performing product (AND PROFIT).
