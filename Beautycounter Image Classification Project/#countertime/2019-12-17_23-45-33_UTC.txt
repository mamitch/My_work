I couldn't have said it better myself. I didn't take care of my skin for a long time. In fact I had invested a little here and there along the way but either didnt see any results or just didn't love the product enough.... along came the Rejuvenating line by Beautycounter.... and 1 week later I was hooked. Then Countertime was released and I knew I had to try it.... and so the rest is history because I'm not only hooked, I'm enjoying and totally believing in this whole skincare world. The natural ingredient one! .

I found that as my skins condition improved so did the results of my makeup. Everything just sits so nicely on my face now..... pretty good deal if you ask me. ðŸ’œ
