Have you been interested in the newest #countertime collection? You’ve seen my posts, I’m clearly obsessed, along with any other person I know who has taken the plunge and tried it! I first started the regimen in July of this year, and JUST YESTERDAY I had to replenish the antioxidant soft day cream! 5 MONTHS later! & I kid you not, I used this sh*t every damn day! I am running low also on the Tripeptide serum and Supreme night cream (and will restock next month on those) but I still have months left of the cleanser, hydrating essence and eye cream! 
With this said, yes this collection is expensive, but OMG is it worth it! Lasting 5+ months?! I’ll never stray! ~In pic~ I gifted myself not only with the #countertime day cream, but also with #beautycounter Melting Body Balm and the Glow & Go Mini Oil Holiday Set!
