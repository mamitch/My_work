Have I ever mentioned how my skin feels like it’s dancing after using Countertime Cleansing Oil? It’s not only ethically sourced but it’s ability to breakdown heavily pigmented and waterproof makeup is incredible. It will never strip your skin or leave it dry. Cleansing Oils have been around for years and I’m so grateful to finally have found the perfect cleanser. 
The key to a flawless makeup look starts with a good skincare routine which ultimately starts with the perfect cleanser. 
This beautiful, recyclable bottle will last months and months.
