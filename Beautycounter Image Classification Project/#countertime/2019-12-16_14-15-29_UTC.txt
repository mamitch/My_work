Better beauty is just smart!!! My derm told me that whatever I have been doing is reversing a lot of the damage that’s been done by the sun. I told him all about my #countertime regimen, safer sunscreen and of course avoiding the sun at all costs (which has really zapped my vitamin d so my physician has me taking D supplements). But seriously if I can get by without ever having a scalpel to my face I’ll take the supplements forever! Let me help you get started with @beautycounter #saferskincare it’s 100% worth making the switch! #makeupartist #aginggracefully #50+
