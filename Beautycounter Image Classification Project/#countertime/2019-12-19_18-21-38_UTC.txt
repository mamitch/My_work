Say hello to one of the most innovative and exciting products in clean beauty history. Countertime! I have seriously NEVER gotten results like this with anything else. Bonus: it’s SAFE for you!! This collection is designed to visibly REVERSE signs of aging 💁🏻‍♀️ and deliver high-performing clean skin-care results, thanks to the innovative plant-derived RETINATURAL COMPLEX. 
For years, many brands (even “cleaner” ones) have touted RETINOL as a safer skin-care ingredient. The problem is, retinoids (and the whole family of vitamin A derivatives) convert to retinoic acid when used on the skin. Many studies have shown that retinoic acid can have harmful side effects, like skin irritation and sensitivity. 😬Retinoids, when used topically and exposed to UV light, have the potential to damage DNA and speed the growth of skin tumors. No thanks! 🙅🏻‍♀️ Enter: The Retinatural Complex featuring Bakuchiol and Swiss Alpine Rose. It gives us retinol-like results without retinol’s safety concerns. It is Beautycounter’s most advanced and innovative skin care collection yet. Not only does it include 6 high-performing products that act to reverse the signs of aging, but Beautycounter has also moved to glass packaging, eliminating over 1 million plastic components and reduce the line's greenhouse gas footprint by an estimated 38%, AND it is EWG verified!! I’m so excited to share this product with you all. By now, you know my passion for clean beauty and contributing to the societal shift in our comprehension and acceptance of the current industry standards. All I can say is that this line truly proves that CLEAN CAN DO ANYTHING!

For my results, I used a combination of the Countertime Collection, the Overnight Resurfacing Peel, and our Balancing + Charcoal Mask. 🖤
