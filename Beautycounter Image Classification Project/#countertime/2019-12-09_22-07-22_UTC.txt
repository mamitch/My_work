Welp, this is me. Post Sunday nap. No makeup. Mid-bite of my sonâ€™s birthday rice crispy treat ðŸ¦• claws. Sick for week 3 (probably) with a sinus infection. But I love the joy I see in my face in this photo. My son and husband wanted to take my picture and while normally Iâ€™d be appalled that I had food in my mouth these two bring me so much joy and I love that I can see that so clearly here. Also, shoutout to @beautycounter for providing me with my best adult skin! Ready to feel glowy in your makeup free face!? Send a DM and Iâ€™ll set you up with a regimen thatâ€™s right for your skin and budget! âœ¨
