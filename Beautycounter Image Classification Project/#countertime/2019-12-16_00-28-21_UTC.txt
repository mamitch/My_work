#selfcaresunday is a thing...right?!? Is my skin oily? No. Us my skin combo? No do I still get an occasional breakout? You bet! Whenever I feel like my skin is in a bit of a funk, this is my go to! Since my skin is on the dry side, I follow up with my countertime regimen and incorporate a facial oil! I use either the brightening with Vitamin C, the plumping for extra hydration, or the balancing oil for times when Iâ€™m having a bit of a breakout! 
I would love to know what you use when you feel like your skin is needing some extra TLC!
