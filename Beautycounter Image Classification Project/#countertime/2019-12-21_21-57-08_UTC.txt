Enjoyed a pre-Christmas ski day with my family today. Prepped my skin for the cold weather temps with #Countertime Essence and soft cream - to which I added 3 drops of brightening oil for some extra hydration and topped it off with dew skin for the spf 20 to protect my face from the sun. Donâ€™t want a goggle tan ðŸ™ˆ #beautycounter #skitheeast #gunstockmtn #countertime
