COUNTERTIME

Ah, my favorite line! Countertime was designed with mature skin mind. And even though that isn’t necessarily me, I still use and love these products. Especially the cleansing oil, which cleans well without drying out my skin.

Featuring our plant-derived Retinatural Complex, this Collection is designed to visibly firm, brighten, and plump the skin. Welcome to the new age of aging well.

The entire 6-piece collection costs $382. The Countertime regimen sells for $267 and comes with everything but the eye cream, however the soft cream and supreme cream are 1 oz instead of 1.7 oz like in the collection. As always, these products can be purchased individually too.

Have any questions? I’d be happy help! #betterbeauty #countertime
