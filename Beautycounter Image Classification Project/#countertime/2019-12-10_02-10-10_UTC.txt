What do these three products have in common? 
They are each the PREP step in an effective skincare regimen. There is more to skincare than just cleansing and moisturizing! @beautycounter regimens follow four steps- CLEANSE, PREP, TREAT, PROTECT. Prep you face for maximal product absorption with a toner. What does a toner do? 
Cleansers increase the pH of our skin, so toners are important in bringing the pH back down to a healthy level. While that super clean, "tight" feeling might feel nice after cleansing, it shouldn't stay like that. Toners balance skin,  minimizing the appearance of pores, help maintain normal oil levels and make the moisturizers we apply after more effective! Unlike what I thought, toners are not just for acne-prone skin, which is why there are a few to choose from based on your skin's needs. 
Double tap ❤️ if you learned something new! If you are using a cleanser and moisturizer and ready to take your skincare to the next level, add in the prep step. I can help you decide which one is right for you!
