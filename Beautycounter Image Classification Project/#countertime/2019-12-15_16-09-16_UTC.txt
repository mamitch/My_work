ADD TO CART🛒 Tomorrow is the shipping cut-off to get most of your goods in time for Christmas🎁⠀
⠀
If you’re still looking for one of your favorite ladies (or yourself😂) get her the Beautycounter Glow-Getter Trio. ⠀
⠀
The Overnight Resurfacing Peel, sloughs off the top two layers of dead skin cells (don’t freak out, you won’t actually see your skin “peel”) while you sleep. ⠀
⠀
Then use the magical Illuminating Glow Cream✨ to hydrate and give your skin the “just from the spa” healthy glow.⠀
⠀
Finally, pop on the Rose Glow Illuminating Cream Highlighter. It’s a natural flush that you can blend in with your fingers (I keep it in my purse for touch ups before I go to evening events).⠀
⠀
Truly the gift “that ya didn’t know you needed but are in ❤️ with”. ⠀
