Ok well I may not be ready for Christmas by any stretch but my makeup, my purse and my Beautycounter hoodie are festive! Does that count?! It’ll have to do!!!

This #iconiceyeshadowpalette is on final close out (if it hasn’t already sold out) and I’m feeling like I should snag a backup since I love it so much! Today I’m wearing ribbon, chiffon, pendant and lace- see stories for deets! No foundation because #Countertime and #instantglowilluminatingcream for the win! Off to the gym, post office and errands!! ❤️🎁🎄
