This won glamour beauty awards for best natural product‼️‼️ Here’s what was said "I've become a big fan of Beautycounter lipstick over the past year. It's so creamy and moisturizing, and I've yet to find a shade I don't like. It's unique shape makes it easy for me to find in my bag, and if your bag looks anything like mine, you would really appreciate that." —Marla Goller, senior video producer
