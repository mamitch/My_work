Holiday vibes are in full effect over here ðŸŽ„ðŸŽ…ðŸ’‹
â€”
We didnâ€™t put up many decorations this year, we havenâ€™t seen Santa or looked at Christmas lights but Iâ€™m embracing the season in more subtle ways
â€”
Spending lots of time hand crafting gifts for our loved ones, doing acts of service for those in need and taking time to love up on my boys. Oh, and wearing as much glitter and red lipstick as possible! ðŸ’‹

You donâ€™t have to do ALL the things to have a good Holiday, I promise it will still be amazing (probably more calm + enjoyable!) Sometimes I need to take my own advice as Iâ€™m not used to slowing down and saying No. it makes me feel like a failure or that Iâ€™m letting others down. I realize I put all this pressure upon myself + that all anyone wants is for me to be happy

So give yourself a pass on something these next 6 days before Christmas. Take a break, let yourself nap, put some red lipstick + glitter on your face + dance around your house (itâ€™s super fun ðŸŽ‰) because YOU deserve it! ðŸ’‹
