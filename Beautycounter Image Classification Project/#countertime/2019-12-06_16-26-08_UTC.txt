I am absolutely in love with these products! I never realized how your face is extremely connected to your body. Since I have been consistent with my skincare, I am noticing my face more and respecting this constant feedback loop and the role that my face plays in my overall well-being. If my hormones are ramping up closer to my cycle, I can see it in my face. If I ate cheese recently I can tell on my jaw line. If I didnâ€™t have a good nights sleep I can notice a difference in my eyes. Skincare is now becoming part of my daily ritual. I am loving the time that I get to spend with myself, directing my energy right back into me, that I get to see visible results from my effort. Unfortunately, it took me 33 years to get to this place with my skincare routine, but with @beautycounter I am really enjoying this process and seeing the rewards is extremely enjoyable! I finally found a way to reflect my inner radiance, outward. ðŸ’—âœ¨ Please reach out of you are interested in learning about cleaner beauty products. .
