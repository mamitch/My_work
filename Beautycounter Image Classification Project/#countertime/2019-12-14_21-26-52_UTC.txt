So I went to a “favorite things” Christmas party last night... 🌲🌲🌲 My 14 year saw what I was bringing and said, “Yep! That totally looks like Willow!” 😉😂 If you don’t have a face wash that smells like a spa treatment and feels like liquid silk on your skin...well, then you might want to try some Countertime Cleansing Oil. ❤️ It’s my favorite. 😉 
And I know a lot of you love it too! •••••••••••••••••
P.S. washing your face with just the right kind of oil is one of the best ways to take care of your skin. 
Especially if you are over 30. 
This Cleansing Oil (and the whole Countertime line) was inspired by Asian beauty rituals....American women are a little late to the face wash game...but we are definitely catching up! 😉
