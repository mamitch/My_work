Give me alllllll the hydration on a Monday. My dry skin is loving Countertime, and I want to scream it from the rooftops for all my fellow dry skin people of the world. It is truly a game changer. I also have to mention that I’m just now replacing my bottle of day cream and the serum that I’ve had since July this year, and I have so much leftover of the other Countertime products. When there are no fillers in your products, a little goes such a long way and these products last! Definitely worth the price point in my opinion when the products last almost 6 months. 🙌🏼
