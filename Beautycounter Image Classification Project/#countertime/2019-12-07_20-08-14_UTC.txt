It’s about that time to start wrapping all the Holiday gifts you’ve bought but are you being mindful of the Holiday waste you are creating?? —
Did you know that “between Thanksgiving and New Year’s Day, the amount of trash produced in the United States increases by an estimated 25%—that’s about one million extra tons of garbage each week” -www.neef.org

That’s a whole lot of Holiday waste going into the landfills which will contribute toward greenhouse gases such as methane, carbon dioxide + water vapors 😱 Methane is most concerning as it has a much higher impact (25x greater) than carbon dioxide on climate change

You know all that shiny + festive wrapping paper that you drool over in the stores?? Well, most of them are NOT recyclable because of the coating on the paper, which is often shiny + laminated 😡 —
What are some ways you can minimize your Holiday waste this season??
🎄 Skip the wrapping paper + use a newspaper or a old magazine
🎄Send a gift in a reusable bag so that they can reuse it to grab groceries 🎄 Save + reuse tissue paper + bags for the next year
🎄 Make homemade bows with ribbon scraps or go for a yarn tassel instead of a shiny bow (which are non-recyclable)
🎄 Carpool to all the Holiday parties to keep fuel emissions down
🎄Use a gift box which can be repurposed + recycled
🎄 Shop at Thrift stores instead of buying  new items
🎄 Gift in glass which is easily recyclable + up cycles well
🎄 Skip the Holiday cards + send e-cards
🎄 Gift an experience over a purchased good
🎄 Recycle your Christmas tree properly

The Environmental Protection Agency says that “the most effective way to reduce waste, and the most environmentally preferred strategy, is to not create it in the first place”. Push yourself to be more mindful this Holiday season about your consumption + waste production. If we all can make a few key changes to lower our Holiday waste the results will be amazing for our planet 🙌🏼♻️🎄
