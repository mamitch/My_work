I have been using @beautycounter Countertime collection (safer retinol alternative) for a few weeks now and Iâ€™m loving the results. Guys, my 40s are lurking around the corner and Iâ€™m kind of kicking myself that Iâ€™m just now getting my sh*t together and taking better care of my skin but.....better late than never!! Right!? So whatâ€™s in this collection?
ðŸŒ¿
Lipid Defense Cleansing Oil is a lightweight cleansing oil that removes makeup and other impurities without stripping lipids (your skinâ€™s natural fats) from the skin. This is meant to be applied to dry skin and then you add in water to create a milky mixture while you cleanse. There is such a misconception about oils and Iâ€™m here to tell you that using a cleansing oil over a traditional cleanser causes less irritation and actually locks in moisture instead of stripping it away.
ðŸŒ¿
Mineral Boost Hydrating Essence. I just introduced this last week after letting my skin adjust to other products in this line. I could tell after just one use how much more radiant and hydrated my skin looked.
ðŸŒ¿
Tripeptide Radiance Serum. This is another Iâ€™ve only just introduced (this week) so Iâ€™ll be sure to share how Iâ€™m liking it at a later time. The serum increases firmness and elasticity as well as reduces fine lines and wrinkles! Goodbye signs of aging!!
ðŸŒ¿
So there are two creams; Antioxidant Soft Cream for AM and Tetrapeptide Supreme Cream for PM. The AM cream improves skinâ€™s barrier function, boosts hydration which helps protect it from daily environmental stressors (i.e. noise, crowding, air quality, etc.) while the PM cream firms and smooths your skin while you are getting your beauty sleep.
ðŸŒ¿
Ultra Renewal Eye Cream. Reduces under-eye shadows and crowâ€™s feet. Iâ€™ve never understood under-eye creams since Iâ€™ve never had results which is why Iâ€™d like to give it another week or two before sharing so you have a better idea of timeline to notice a difference.
