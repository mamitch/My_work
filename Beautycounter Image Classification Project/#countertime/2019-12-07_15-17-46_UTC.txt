One of the MANY reasons why I’m obsessed with Beautycounter - COUNTERTIME. Beautycounter’s anti-aging regimen that uses Retinatural, a safer alternative to Retinol, a common ingredient in anti-aging products. -

Retinol can be a skin irritant and makes the skin sensitive to sun damaging rays. It is not safe when pregnant or nursing and scores a 9 out of 10 EWG rating. In fact, the European Union and Canada restrict the use of Retinol due to concerns of its affects on human health. -

COUNTERTIME’s plant-derived Retinatural Complex is made with two power house ingredients: Bakuchiol and Swiss Alpine Rose, that delivers retinol-like results without retinol’s safety concerns! Countertime is expertly formulate to: -
-reduce fine lines and wrinkles
- increase skin elasticity and plumpness
- decrease dryness, dullness and redness
- brighten and even skin tone
- smooth and soften skin -
