Three generations for safer beauty. This time it’s personal. 
Because she has been exposed to more chemicals in her lifetime at 11 than her great grandparents did in there entire lifetime. 
Because the products marketed and completely legal to be on the shelf are linked to infertility, hormone disruption, cancer and other health issues. 
Because the EU has banned over 1500 ingredients and the US has only banned 30 from personal care products. Stay woke people. 👏🏽 Because health issues in today’s society are more linked to environmental factors than genetics and it’s one thing we can decide on what we control. 
Because I know better and now that I do I can’t NOT share the disconnect in regulation and what is on the market. 
Three generations transforming the industry. Proud of my girl for politely passing to try another skin brand tonight because it wasn’t Beautycounter and she didn’t know the ingredients. 
This is why. No one is doing what we are doing.
