It can be so hard to find time for any kind of self care during the busy holiday season.  The one thing I never let go of no matter how much I have on my plate is taking good care of my skin.  My evening ritual is sacred to me.  This may sound odd but it helps me to get mentally prepared to relax.  So I never skip it!  I literally can’t sleep if I don’t wash my face first! .
.
Right now, I’m loving the this three step combo I’ve been doing every couple days.  Do you use a facial shaver?  Shaving your face isn’t just for men!  It exfoliates your skin gently and effectively, so you’re products can get in there and do their thang! 👊🏽 .
