Am I the only one that thinks of Britney Spears when I see these?😂⠀

I have super oily and acne prone skin so the idea of adding oil to it seemed a little crazy. ⠀

Did you know that certain lightweight oils can actually have anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory properties? ⠀
⠀
Instead of stripping your skin of all its oil so that it overproduces it, the No. 3 Balancing oil actually helps skin regulate its moisture (and chill the heck out!)⠀

Ok, but to the really important part of this conversation- Anyone know the name of that Britney song?😂👇🏼⠀
