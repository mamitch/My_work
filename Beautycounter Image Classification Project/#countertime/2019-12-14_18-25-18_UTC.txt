This year has made me stronger, more open minded, compassionate and has FOREVER changed me —
It hasn’t been an easy year (what year is easy??) but I’ve felt a lot of personal growth from the experience of losing my Dad this summer. Yesterday marked 6 months since he has passed + the reality is really sinking in that he is gone and not coming back. This is probably the hardest month I’ve had in awhile...holidays bring back lots of memories/traditions that we used to do. Taking it day by day + giving myself lots of space to feel whatever emotions may come

For anyone else going through a hard time, I’m sending you lots of love! I’m also letting you know it’s okay to not do all the things you normally do every holiday season...you don’t have to decorate, buy a tree or presents, go see Christmas lights. You can just do whatever it is that makes you happy + keeps you sane ❤️

What are you allowing yourself to leave off your plate this year??
