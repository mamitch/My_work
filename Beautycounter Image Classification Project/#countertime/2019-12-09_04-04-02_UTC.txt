Happy, holiday skin is as easy as 1-2-3. ⁣
⁣
1. PREP. I am toner-obsessed because I have experienced how much better able my skin is able to absorb and receive all the goodness I put on it after I’ve toned. Currently can’t get enough of the #countermatch hydra-gel radiance toner. It’s so nourishing, it almost makes me forget to finish my regimen! ⁣
⁣
2. TREAT. All winter long, I am Team Facial Oil. I rotate through the three pictured here to 1: brighten, 2: plump, and 3: balance. Tonight I brightened since I’ve been feeling the lack of vitamin d in my days..!⁣
⁣
3. PROTECT. Moisturizers lock in the goodness that you’ve applied to your skin and help further nourish and hydrate. I use the new #countertime soft cream morning and night, and for me, it’s a perfect complement to these cold, dry days.⁣

For the happiest holiday skin, focus first on your consistent skin care and then on all the sparkly palettes and glisteny glosses 😘 #skinregimens #takecareofyou
