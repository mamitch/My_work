Sometimes I take my vitamins + drink kombucha...other days I eat cookies + barely remember to stay hydrated 🙈It’s all about balance right?! 💁🏻‍♀️

This month is kicking my butt royally between trying to keep my sanity together, deal with toddler shenanigans + heal myself physically as well as mentally. Can I just go back to the days where I believed in Santa + the most stressful part of the Holidays was deciding how many cookies to leave out for Santa? 🎅

Just keep swimming, just keep swimming, just keep eating ALL the GF cookies 🤣 How are you all keeping your sanity together this month? Please don’t tell me I’m the only one who eats cookies in the bathroom hiding from my kids 🤣🙈
