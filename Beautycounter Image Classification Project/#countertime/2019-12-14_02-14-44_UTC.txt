It’s only been about 2 weeks since I’ve started my new skincare routine but I love how my face feels. Having nothing but clean, pure products is so important. I was introduced to @beautycounter a while back by a friend from nursing school- I was hesitant at first but then decided to dive in last month and made my first purchase. Since I’m hitting 30 in a two years I wanted to really crack down on decreasing the “cracks” in my face  and preventing new ones. I chose the Countertime regime because it focuses on anti-aging. Although I know that it is impossible to prevent aging, I’d like to help slow it down physically. Check out the other clean products that they have to offer. I for sure will slowly be replacing my makeup with this clean beauty as well! Inquire for more information with my good friend @k_tonack
