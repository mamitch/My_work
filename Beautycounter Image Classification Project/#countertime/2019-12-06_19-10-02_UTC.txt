I’m a keep it simple kind of gal!

I try to keep my skincare routine to a minimum but I recently added a couple more steps and I couldn’t be happier with the results. To be honest I’m a little obsessed with how my skin feels and looks. My skin feels so hydrated, smooth and even!

The Countertime Essence is so freaking good! Sometimes you love something more than you thought! It’s like a toner but has more benefits. It’s lightweight and provides the moisture barrier your skin needs to stay hydrated and radiant!

Treat your skin to some safer hydration this winter!
