Day 11: Countertime

COUNTERTIME...think Retinol without the harmful side effects. Same or better results, with this Retinatural Complex. Made with:
BAKUCHIOL: Retinol alternative, age-defying and reparative. Mimics and sometimes exceed the performance of retinol.
SWISS ALPINE ROSE: 🌹 grown at the highest altitudes of the Swiss Alps. Protects against dehydration and environmental stressors. Rich anti-oxidant.

In 💗 with this! For the first time since I was in my 20s, my skin is not dry, the surface feels amazing, and I feel like I am aging in reverse. Countertime Tripeptide Supreme Cream feels like La Mer, but 70% cheaper 🙌

The whole collection is my favorite...
