Skincare so ✨luxurious✨ it should be displayed! I’m loving my #countertime on this vintage tray. It just felt wrong to hide it under the sink! I’m a few months in with this set and I just love the results. I’m noticing less fine lines. My skin feels hydrated and supple. I also notice a difference in my under eye area using the eye cream. The packaging makes this set feel like it costs $1000 but it doesn’t. I compared other luxury skincare lines and it makes our set feel like a bargain. Plus one pump of each is all you need! I expect this to last over 6 months or longer. So happy with this set! 💕 ——
From BC.com “FEATURED INGREDIENTS
Retinatural Complex: We took two of the most powerhouse plant-derived ingredients available and created a scientific breakthrough. Bakuchiol has been shown to provide skin-care results that are comparable to retinol—without harmful side effects such as skin irritation and increased sun sensitivity—and Swiss Alpine rose boosts the skin’s antioxidant defense.
Vitamin E and Essential Fatty Acids: Help to maintain the integrity of the skin’s moisture barrier.

Inspired by Asian beauty rituals and informed by Japanese technology, this luxurious, lightweight cleansing oil gently yet effectively removes makeup and impurities without stripping essential lipids from the skin. Rich in vitamin E, fatty acids, and our plant-derived Retinatural Complex, the formula reinforces the skin’s fragile moisture barrier for a soothed, nourished complexion.” RESULTS THAT SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES
