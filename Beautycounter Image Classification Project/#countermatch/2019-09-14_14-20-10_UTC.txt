Michael is gone to the grocery and to pick up our Samâ€™s Club haul. Brin is taking her morning nap, leaving just me and Carley (who is 4 paws deep under the sheets). SO that means I have about an hour and a half to myself. What do I do? Pull out all the goodies and give myself a facial!!! Okay, and maybe fold these 3 baskets of clothes. Hope you have a happy Saturday!
