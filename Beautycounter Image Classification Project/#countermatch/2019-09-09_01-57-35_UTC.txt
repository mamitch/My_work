The closest thing to a spa for this mama currently ⚡️
Getting all the day’s *fall but still feels like summer* sweat off with Countermatch pure calm cleansing milk! I love the fact that this doesn’t lather. It just goes on like cream but it’s totally effective and just rinse with warm water!
After, I put on a few pumps from the leave-on overnight resurfacing peel AKA bottle of GOLD! This stuff is like microdermabrasion in a bottle. It doesn’t literally peel your skin, but gently clears away old skin cells & leaves your skin smoother, softer & with more even skin tones!
Eye rescue cream for brightening the tired mama eyes...aaaaand top off with the recovery night cream to revive & hydrate while you catch those Z’s!

Perfect way to get a mini spa session in less than 5 minutes with these high quality, safer & effective products! Mama or not, you deserve to get your at-home spa ready! | link to shop in my bio ✨
