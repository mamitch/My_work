Did you know women eat 7 pounds of lipstick in their lifetime. 😲 (I googled that). How much of your lifetime have you been eating lipstick with harmful chemicals? For me it was about 25 years. Definitely glad I made the switch to #saferproducts with @beautycounter
I always keep the sheer lipstick in my car! This one is Shimmery Roses Pink 💄Link in my bio for more info! 😍
