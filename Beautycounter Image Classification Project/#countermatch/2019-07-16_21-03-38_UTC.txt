The BEST skin hydration combo in all the land!

2 pumps of Countermatch Adaptive Body Moisturizer + 1 squirt of Rosemary Citrus Body Oil = Hydration for Daaaaaaaaays!

This is the only combo that keeps my legs smooth and beat part is it is so light! So gooey, heavy, sticky cream to deal with in the hot temps.
