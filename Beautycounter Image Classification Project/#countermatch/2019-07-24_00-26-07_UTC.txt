ðŸ–¤ CHARCOAL MASK ðŸ–¤ 
One of the best masks EVER! I absolutely love this stuff!! This nutrient-rich kaolin clay mask deep-cleans and balances, absorbing excess oil and drawing out impurities. Activated charcoal minimizes the appearance of pores, giving skin a smooth, refined appearance, while salicylic acid stimulates exfoliation. Perfect for those concerned with congestion and oily skin.
