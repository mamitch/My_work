Last night, I was reading an article about a well known skincare brand. Im not going to say which one because I don’t want this to be taken as “bashing” another company. Anyways, I couldn’t believe what I was reading, I couldn’t believe that products targeted towards women had so many hormone disrupting chemicals in them and chemicals that are directly linked to cancer. So, I am going to share some of the chemicals that are in these particular products and I really hope everyone will take a few minutes to read this and then check your products! Knowing what you are putting on your skin is so important and I hope this helps!
