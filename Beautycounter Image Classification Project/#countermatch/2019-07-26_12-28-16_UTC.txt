Why a regimen? Can’t I just use the cleanser, or the night cream on it’s own? 
You get the results you want (in the case of Countertime...smoother, firmer, brighter skin) when you use the products the way they were developed and tested for years before they launch. 
So while using the products individually can help, you won’t see the full impact of what your skin can really become. 
Another bonus of using the regimen is that you save money on the set over individual product purchase. Regimens are created and sized to deplete at the same time, so you aren’t left needing one item weeks ahead of the rest. (That drives me nuts!) Get to know all the  @beautycounter regimens by messaging me or taking the skincare quiz linked in my bio. 
There is a safer solution for all skin types and concerns.
