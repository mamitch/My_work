So I have a ritual on Saturday nights. It includes getting the kids to bed, reading them stories and then setting into taking my weekly methotrexate. -
Not gonna lie, it takes all my nerve to Steel my mind to inject it and make myself feel terrible.  I have not had the easiest time with this medication, and have had the dose reduced to ease side effects. Down side is that it doesn’t seem to help my RA as the whole dose does. -
So what do I do to make the situation better?! I believe in doing a whole lot of self care. I do a charcoal mask from @beautycounter , I go for a hot bath and use my favourite scents from @sajewellness . I use #painrelease with lots of Epsom salts. Then I apply my #countertime night regimen and apply #countermatch body lotion. After I head into my bedroom and turn on the diffuser and use #spaspirit and use the roll on #sleepwell .

On Saturday night I might have to take a terrible medication, but I do what it takes to draw out toxins from my skin and take care of myself. -
I have support at home on theses nights and into Sunday to help with the kids and prepare for the week ahead. What I am learning is that Sunday isn’t always a total loss if I take care of myself first. I wish it didn’t take a medication to make me stop and take care of myself first. But it did, so my lesson to you is find what helps take care of you. It does not have to be a big long drawn out process, it could be 5 min of meditating, but take that moment for YOURELF. No one else can do it for you and you are important to the people around you!! -
