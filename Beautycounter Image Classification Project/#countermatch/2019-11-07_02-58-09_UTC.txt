I have never found skincare that I liked. I was reluctant to try BeautyCounter because of the cost.  But I took the risk and LOVE it! I only use this routine 3-4 times a week and it works great for me. Here is the order I do things in: 
1. Cleansing Milk
2. Acne Treatment
3. Morning- Adaptive Moisture  Night - Sleeping Cream 
The number one thing I hear about BeautyCounter is: it is so expensive. I hear ya. I thought the same thing. Look at this way; how much do you spend on your box store bought products? How many times a year do you buy those products? Is it really more expensive than these products when you think about it as a yearly cost? I buy my BeautyCounter products 2-4 times a year depending on the product. Because of the small amount of these products I have to use, I spend far less in a year on these products than I did on box store products. If you want to know more about this, please ask!
