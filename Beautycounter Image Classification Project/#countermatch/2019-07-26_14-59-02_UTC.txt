A study by Campaign for Safe Cosmetics found cancer causing chemicals in popular baby products. 
Tips for buying safe baby products:
🌱Do research on EWG skindeep website before buying baby shampoo, lotion, diaper rash cream etc.
🌱Avoid anything with phthalates, parabens, or synthetic fragrances
🌱Read the labels and don’t be duped. Baby shampoo claims like “tear free” and “gentle” doesn’t mean safe.

🔻Ingredients with the letters PEG at the beginning or ETH at the end.
🔻Fragrance
🔻Triclosan
🔻Quaternium 15
