People often don’t start something because the overall goal feels overwhelming. Start small. It’s not cheap to switch over your entire skincare, hair products, makeup, etc at once. That’s not doable for 99% of us. Just start where you can. Start with the products you use most often and that cover the most ground...think body lotion, face lotion, foundation, eye cream. Most people use these daily. They’re the easiest to swap out first. These are affordable and clean options. @beautycounter Countermatch Eye Rescue Cream, Countermatch Adaptive Moisture Lotion, Tint Skin Foundation and Dew Skin 3 with SPF #betterbeauty #cleanbeauty #countermatch #beautycounterconsultant #beautycounter #milspouse
