this is technically a #repost of my “why” from earlier this year. at first, I was so reluctant to share my before photo. I spent years hiding behind makeup and wasn’t sure I was ready for the make-up-free, filter-free version to be out there. but, like most things outside of my comfort zone, it was worth it and then some. the number of people - some close to me and others complete strangers - who thanked me for sharing my story and helping them find a solution to their skin issues blew my mind. it is here in this space - a space where my sharing has the potential to help even one other person - that I feel my best. if you are hiding your skin instead of living your best life in it - the fix could be only one step away. I’d love the privilege of helping you find that fix together.
