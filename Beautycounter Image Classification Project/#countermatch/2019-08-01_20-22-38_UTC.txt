Beautycounter is deeply involved in pressing local, state and even the federal government for more health-protective legislation governing the personal care industry. That’s right, Beautycounter is actively asking the government for more regulation of its own industry – because our founders believe that there’s more to this multi-billion dollar industry than just the bottom line. They truly believe that beauty should be good for you, and their products and their advocacy work reflects that.
