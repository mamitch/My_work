Beautycounter is ALL UP in the press!! And yes that first picture is in THE NEW YORK TIMES👇🏼👇🏼 “If you think we are just selling lipstick, you’re not paying attention”
This couldn’t be a more true statement! 
Yes, yes we have great products - they are definitely something to be proud of. 
BUT- the real work we are doing is EDUCATING AND ADVOCATING! We are making people (like you) ask questions! - “Why are my products toxic?”
- “Why is the FDA allowing this?” - “What rose am I using that has NO REGULATION or safety testing and standards?!” Beautycounter has opened my eyes to so much more than personal care products!!!! I have began to question and see so much more is unsafe for me and my family! 
It’s time to stand up and use your voice, vote with your dollar and demand change!!! @beautycounter
