Ok, so I've got horrible eczema, dry and oily skin. Anyone out there know what I mean ❓

I was actually at the end of my rope, carrying around an expensive moisturizer from England in my purse and reapplying every half hour to prevent my skin from becoming peely and scaly. 🐍

Enter: Beautycounter's Countermatch collection! Instantly, I felt my red and inflamed skin soothed and it's been my jam every day twice a day for the last 1.5 years. 🎉

Literally the only thing that was missing from my routine was a toner to help balance the pH and remove residual debris left over from cleansing (helping to prevent those pesky blemishes). As of today, the Hydra-Gel Toner has been released as step 2 of our 5-step Countermatch collection! This girl couldn't be more excited! 💥
