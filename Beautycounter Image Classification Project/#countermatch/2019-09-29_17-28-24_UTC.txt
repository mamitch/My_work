Sunday Funday! Who wants to try a ✨FREE SAMPLE ✨of the new #Countertime line from @beautycounter 🙋🏻‍♀️?! .
.
.
I have been using it since its launch and I have ALL the lovin’ feels. It uses “Retinatural” a safer form of retinol (which has been all over the news... @voguemagazine @instylemagazine) I feel good about my skin, and what I’m putting on it! Don’t forget...it is your biggest organ and the stuff you put on it daily is important!  If you want some help or recommendations with switching to safer for your skin type, I’m you’re girl! .

I was a #countermatch queen 👑 before and have samples of either line as well as #countercontrol, (great for oily skin, acne, and teens) too! Slip me some love in my DMs for your free sample!#samplesunday #switchtosafer #betterbeauty #freegiveaway #skincare #feelinggoodinmyownskin #smoothskin #andimfeelinggood
