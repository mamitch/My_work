What's your skin type? Tell me in the comments 💁🏻‍♀️ If you're not sure, go to the link in my bio and take the 1 minute skincare quiz!

If you've got a mirror, then you've probably looked at it in the morning while getting ready and thought "This is as good as it's gonna get" with a shrug. Then you're out the door. That doesn't have to be the case. Whether you're a man or woman, teenager or adult, the skincare routine you're using probably isn't right for your skin type. 
There are really 4 skin types: oily, normal, dry, and combination. From there, you might be acne prone, you might have facial hair if you're a man or teen boy, or you may have mature skin. So finding a regimen suited for your particular skin type might seem difficult. @beautycounter is here to help! 👉🏼 Countercontrol is best suited for oily acne-prone skin whether you're a teen or adult because breakouts happen no matter your age. 👉🏼 Countermatch is good for normal and dry skin types because it's formulated with Bio-mimic technology which delivers the exact amount of moisture your skin needs. 👉🏼 Counterman is perfect for men of all ages whether you've got a beard or bare skin. ⏳ Lastly, mark you calendars for July 9th when our newest skincare line is all about aging well. You'll want to get your hands on it! 
Don't forget that you can get your choice between 2 luxe skincare sets with a $175+ order.
