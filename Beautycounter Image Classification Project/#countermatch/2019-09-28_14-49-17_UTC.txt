The Lotus Glow Cleansing Balm can be used for EVERYTHING! 
This multi-tasking cleansing balm, perfect for day and night use, hydrates while it cleanses, removing makeup and impurities with nourishing ingredients that wonâ€™t strip away your skinâ€™s natural moisture. (Bonus: it can also be used as a mask for a hydrating overnight facial.) With a blend of lotus extract, jojoba seed oil, and avocado seed oil, Lotus Glow Cleansing Balm soothes and destresses skin while increasing luminosity.
