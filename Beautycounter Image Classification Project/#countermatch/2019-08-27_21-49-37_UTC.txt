Did you know Beautycounter has a never list of over 1500 ingredients! When formulating our products, we prohibit the use of over 1500 harmful or questionable ingredients! ✅✅✅✅ Did you also know the beauty industry is virtually unregulated! The US bans somewhere around only 30 ingredients! Beautycounter bans even more than the 1400 the EU bans! ⤵️⤵️⤵️⤵️ What’s even cooler is we have new and improved packaging that’s more sustainable and sleek looking! Check out my story for more information on that! ⤴️⤴️⤴️ Why else do I love Beautycounter? Because the products truly work! I have struggled with acne most of my adult life and although I have found products that work they weren’t the safer skincare I was looking for. I haven’t even tried the acne line yet and the products already have me feeling more comfortable in my skin! Beautycounter fell into my lap and I knew it was a match! ✌️❤️ #beautycounter #beautycounterconsultant #countermatch #counterplus #makeover #charcoalmask #charcoalbar #twoofmyfavoritethings #saferskincare #thatworks
