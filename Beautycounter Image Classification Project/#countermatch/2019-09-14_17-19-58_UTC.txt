Saturday morning off to @afstl for our Bébé et Moi class before I finish up the last of my “vacation to do list.” For the past week I stayed home to reset (with the exception of Heat Watch Wednesday when not only did I report for work, but worked outside). I have spent the last week in pajamas and moisturizers and it has been GLORIOUS.  The hubs is also on vacation so By this morning I was ready to take advantage of a second set of hands for the kid, and take my time and throw some makeup over my skin care routine:
