07.02.2019 // A few @beautycounter updates for the new month! •
1. You still have the option to choose safer products for an awesome deal that includes a free travel set of your choice! This promotion ends Friday night, so if you've been contemplating making a purchase you have a few more days. • 
2. The new Countertime collection launches in 7 days! This new collection is for anyone who enjoys the rejuvenating collection and/or has mature skin or texture issues. It's also our way of taking one step further in being more sustainable, glass packaging!!
•
3. The new Band of Beauty member welcome gift is a Charcoal Cleansing Bar ($26 value). The Band of Beauty program is a subscription, where you pay $29 a year. With this you earn free shipping on orders over $100, 10% product credit on applicable orders, the welcome gift when you spend $50+ on products when enrolling in the program, and you'll receive exclusive member offers. •
4. And finally, there has been a new product added to the host rewards line up. If you choose to host a pop up or event during the months of July, August, or September, you'll be eligible to receive the Countermatch Adaptive Body Moisturizer.
