Swipe for before pics. My breakouts are something fierce, but the finished product doesn’t look too shabby. I had a completely different outcome with the Tint Skin using a liquid foundation brush instead of a beauty blender. Anyone out there that thought our foundation never “set,” (me) the brush made all the difference. ⁣
