Hey friends! Some of you may know, but I started my beautycounter journey a couple of months ago. I didnâ€™t realize all of the toxins and harsh chemicals that were in my everyday products. I am so glad I chose to put my health first and choose safe, chemical-free  products that I can feel good about. beautycounter.com/lexyherron
