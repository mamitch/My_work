Your skin is the largest organ in your body. When you lather yourself with harmful ingredients, you are actually clogging your pores with toxins. This easily leads to increased acne, signs of aging, and a variety of other skin care problems. But those problems go much deeper than your skin. 
Your skin absorbs a large portion of those toxic chemicals which then enter your bloodstream and become stored in your body’s tissues, wreaking havoc on your health. 
A CDC study showed that the average adult has hundreds of synthetic chemicals in their blood stream. An average of 287 chemical toxins have been detected within the umbilical cord blood of newborns. Introducing synthetic chemicals to your body affects your skin’s natural healing processes, causing irritation which often results in red, dry and flaky skin. 
Additionally, your body’s immune and respiratory systems and even vision can be affected.
