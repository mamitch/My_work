Little example of one routine I rotate in through the week, second photo is right after application of this routine. Also, I was having a great hair day and it had to be documented. Also, still getting used to taking photos of myself and feel awkward looking at the camera! 🌿

So easy. So simple. I would recommend the crap out of this even if I wasn’t selling it! I have been SO self conscious of my skin since high school. I had bad acne, scarring from that, and very rough, uneven tone. That second photo is without filter, without makeup.. I would have NEVER posted that a month ago before I started with Beautycounter products. 🙅🏼‍♀️ Although.. you should be happy in the skin you’re in - but I can help if you need a boost! ❤️

So, would I love to be your consultant? Heck yeah, obviously! But honestly, I’d be happy for you if you found this through someone else even! Not only do the products work - but they are CLEAN, deprived of over 1500 harmful ingredients. 🛑 I wish I would have found this sooner. But so thankful I have it now! You can’t put a price on safety or feeling fantastic. 💁🏼‍♀️
