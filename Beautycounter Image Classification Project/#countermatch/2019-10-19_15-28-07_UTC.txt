Heading out to work earlier than usual this October Saturday. I did my makeup while sitting on the play mat, while Brinley used my makeup brushes as drumsticks, so I could soak up every second with her that I get today. This isn’t our signature #FlawlessInFive set but it’s my go-to and done in five minutes still. Details below in order applied. What are you doing in this beautiful Saturday? And what’s your go-to makeup of choice?
