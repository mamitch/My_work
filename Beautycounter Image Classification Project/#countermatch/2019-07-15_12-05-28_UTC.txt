During the summer months, once I’ve got some sun kissed glow, my makeup routine gets even simpler. It always begins with a good moisturizer. I find my skin is on the dryer side, and love the #countermatch lotion. This is followed by #dewskin a very light tinted moisturizer. It provides minimal coverage with SPF 20. The concealer pen is great for spots and under eyes. The mattifying powder leaves skin smooth with an even finish. Lastly eyes and brows. A quick eyeliner, brow gel and mascara. I love the volumizing mascara! Ps. Don’t forget the lips. If you’re into colours there’s a huge variety. If you prefer the minimal look there’s a nice sheer lip options 💋DM me for more info...what’s your makeup routine like? ⬇️
