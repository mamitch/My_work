I love everything about the Countermatch collection but the Recovery Sleeping Cream deserves extra praise! Especially this time of year when we often need a little extra💧. {Not just because this is one of my all time favorite products 🤩}⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
✔️Yes, you will get the best results when using a complete regimen. But If your skin needs a little extra hydration, this gem will do the trick! ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
✔️Yes, you can use it AM and PM! It’s simply the richer cream in this collection, which is generally used at night, but it’s perfectly fine to use in the mornings! What’s important is safe ingredients and giving our skin what it needs! ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
🙋🏼‍♀️As always, let me know if you have any questions or if I can do anything to help you make some safer swaps!
