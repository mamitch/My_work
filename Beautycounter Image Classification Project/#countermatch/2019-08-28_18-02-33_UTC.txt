Stepping right out if my comfort zone here!! I have recorded my first video to show off my morning routine 😊

The products used in this video are:
1. Countermatch Pure Calm Cleansing Milk 
2. Countertime Mineral Boost Hydrating Essence
3. Countertime Tripeptide Radiance Serum
4. Countermatch Adaptive Moisture with the No.1 Brightening Oil
5. Rejuvenating Eye Cream
6. Counter+ Brightening Facial Mist 
I use a combination of different collections/regimens right now. Collections, especially the Countertime Collection, will have the best results if you use the entire collection together. I just started using the Countertime products, and also use the Countertime night cream in the evening instead of my #4. I will keep you all posted in the results in a few weeks with this combo!! Countertime itself is best for dry/normal aging skin, and I find my skin to me normal/oily, but these few products are still great for me and are the highest performing for anti-aging! Goodbye forehead wrinkles!!🙏 My rejuvenating eye cream is no longer available as the rejuvenating line was replaced by Countertime! I will be using the Countertime Eye Cream when this one runs out, and have already used it for about a week to try it out and I like it even better so I can't wait!! Let me know if you have any questions 😊
