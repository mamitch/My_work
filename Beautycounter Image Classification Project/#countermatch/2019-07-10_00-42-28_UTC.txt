First day back to the grind after 5 days off - the struggle was real!

Thankful for: * COFFEE ☕️🙋‍♀️ * The scrub life (YAY for not having to plan a work outfit every day 👏) * Amazing coworkers! ❤️
* Countermatch eye rescue cream 👌

Not only does routine use reduce fine lines and wrinkles, but it also decreases puffiness and darkness around and under the eye ☺️ Can I get an “AMEN”!? Hello, bright eyes!
