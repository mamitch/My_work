Reunited and it feels so good... 🎶

{Ok, who has that song stuck in their head now? 😂🙈 #sorrynotsorry}

Y’all, I have to fess up. I have been cheating on my Countertime Supreme Cream from @beautycounter with this, my beloved Countermatch Recovery Sleeping Cream.🥰
—
Yes, it’s true. While I love the texture of the Supreme Cream my hormonal, acne-prone skin wasn’t loving it and it was repaying me with some gnarly cystic acne. 😱 Then comes this superstar in all her newly-packaged glory and saves the day! 🦸‍♀️ Just one quick switch and my skin is back to normal.🙌

And that’s one of the many things I love about Beautycounter: you can mix and match the products to fit the unique needs of your skin. Not everything will work for everyone and that’s ok! 👌
—
My recommendation to you if you have sensitive skin but want to try #Countertime is to introduce the products one at a time (think one new product each week) to see how your skin likes it. If you have acne-prone &/or oily skin, you may even want to skip the Supreme Cream altogether and use the Sleeping Cream instead (which you can get for 15% off today 🙌). As always, I’m here to help if you need any guidance!

Ok and now can we talk about this new packaging? I’m loving it, how about you?😍
