Countermatch got a makeover! The same great skincare line with a brand new look. Plus we added a #hydragel toner to complete your daily #regimen 
Our Countermatch Collection is formulated to match the natural structure of the skin and deliver long-lasting moisture—for an everyday glow.

Countermatch Pure Calm Cleansing Milk (150 ML / 5 FL OZ): This ultra-gentle cleanser removes makeup and impurities without surfactants that can strip away natural oils. Its conditioning formula respects the skin’s balance, replenishing essential hydration so skin feels soft and nourished, never dry or tight.

Countermatch Hydra-Gel Radiance Toner (150 ML / 5 FL OZ): This is the prep step you’ve been waiting for. With a unique gel texture and a sustainable glass bottle, this toner helps minimize the appearance of pores while removing residual impurities, leaving skin hydrated and radiant. 
Countermatch Intense Moisture Serum (30 ML / 1 FL OZ): Packed with two forms of hyaluronic acid, plus vitamins C and E, this intensely moisturizing serum delivers a boost of lasting hydration and antioxidant protection. With continued use, skin will feel firmer and look brighter with a more even tone.

Countermatch Adaptive Moisture Lotion (50 ML / 1.7 FL OZ): This lightweight lotion provides up to 24 hours of essential hydration* and adapts to skin throughout the day for a smooth feel and radiant glow. *Based on a 30-subject clinical hydration study over 24 hours.

Countermatch Recovery Sleeping Cream (50 ML / 1.7 FL OZ): This overnight cream helps create a protective layer to shield skin from moisture loss during sleep. The advanced formula replenishes hydration and revitalizes skin with a blend of hyaluronic acid, squalane, plum oil, and phytic acid.
