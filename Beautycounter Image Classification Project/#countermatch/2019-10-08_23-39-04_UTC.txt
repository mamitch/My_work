7 Reasons why a skin care routine is essential 👇🏼👇🏼👇🏼👇🏼👇🏼👇🏼👇🏼👇🏼👇🏼👇🏼👇🏼👇🏼👇🏼👇🏼👇🏼 1. The skin sheds itself everyday – You may think your skin is healthy, but did you know your skin cells shed just about every minute of every day? This means the healthy skin you have today will shed tomorrow, so if you don’t care for it now you could lose it to dull, less than perfect skin. This is a great reason to develop a daily skin care routine.  Beautycounter’s charcoal mask is a great way to remove the dead skin on the face and keep your skin glowing.

2. All skin types are different – We all have a friend who doesn’t have a skin care routine and her skin looks great. Well that is great for her, but all skin types are different. For this reason, your skin may need more care than the next person. A daily skin care routine is very important.

3. Beautiful skin is a lifelong process – If you want gorgeous skin 30 years from now, the choices you make today will make it a reality. Beautiful skin is a daily effort and developing a healthy skin care routine today will help you maintain beautiful skin for the future. At the same time, negative skin care routines now can harm your skin for the future.

4. Prevention – Preventing potential skin problems now is easier than trying to fix skin issues in the future. Taking the time to involve yourself in a skin care routine daily takes less time and effort than having to see dermatologists or address skin issues as a result of neglect down the line.

5. Saves money – When you take care of your skin health, you avoid issues down the line that can be expensive. If you don’t want to deal with acne scars, deep wrinkles, skin discolouration, or other skin issues, a skin care routine now can prevent all of the above.

6. When you look good you feel good – Well maintained skin can help boost your confidence and keep you looking your best! Your face is the first thing others see when they meet you, so put your best face forward. A daily skin care routine can help you achieve this.

7. A skin care routine can play a positive role in the rest of your life– Add a skin care routine to your other healthy living routines
