Lazy Sunday! 
These are my go-to products when I want to keep it simple. Washed with Countermatch cleansing milk then applied the Adaptive Moisture Lotion. This stuff is the best, provides 24 hours of hydration! Dew skin for a little color and SPF 20! Petal sheer lipstick for some hydration and a pretty pink 😍
