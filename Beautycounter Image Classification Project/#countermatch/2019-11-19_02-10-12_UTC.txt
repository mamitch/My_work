An honest moment about this moisturizer... The first time I purchased it in August 2018 (as a client, not consultant) I was frustrated. Frustrated that I just spent $50 on such a small tube when I could get 4x more for $10 at the drugstore. Was I about to fly through it with daily use? Then I used it. Not only has it done wonders for my skin, but it lasted a long time. (Just look at the difference between the full and empty bottle; Iâ€™m finishing up my second one now!) This little moisturizer may be small, but it's SO GOOD. I only use half a pump every morning (and love to add a couple drops of brightening oil) and I get at least six months use out it. It works because it adapts to my skin's needs with Bio-Mimic Technology and provides hydration all day. I started using it when my skin was literally peeling from dryness and this healed it! Now I use it all year long; it's great for cold winters and hot summers. 
So if you can't get over sticker shock shopping @beautycounter, know I was right there with you. But, I think you'll be surprised just how effective these products are and how long they last. I definitely have! With intentional, safer ingredients, a little really does go a long way. I'm here to help you find what's best for you, considering both your skin and your budget!
