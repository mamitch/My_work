Here’s a late night #Tuesdaytip for you. You don’t need nearly as much product as you think. A tiny bit goes a long way! I’m on month 5 month of my original regiment set and still not empty! I use them every single morning and night.

Is it an investment? Yes! Is it worth it? ABSOLUTELY! If you know me, you know I don’t buy anything unless it’s on sale or I’ve price matched everywhere online (or have Kohl’s Cash). So I get that spending money on yourself and your skincare can make you feel guilty at first but I promise you won’t regret it. You work hard and deserve the only BEST for yourself and your skin.
