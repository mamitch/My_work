If you haven’t already checked out this amazing event @motherdaughterempower happening this weekend, check it out now! Every detail thought through with love and intention. When Raylee is old enough to attend you can bet we will be the first to sign up 🙋‍♀️ and I’m lucky enough to send the cutest #motherdaughter #cleanbeauty @beautycounter skin care package along with a face cleanser suitable for the girls and mom as well as the #countermatch lotion! I hope everyone attending has a beautiful weekend 🌞
