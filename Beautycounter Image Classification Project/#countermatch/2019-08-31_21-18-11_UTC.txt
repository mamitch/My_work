Why I chose B C
â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €
I wasn't looking for safer products. I didn't know *safer* was even a thing. I was looking for something that worked. I was sick of trying drug store stuff that irritated my face and didn't want to buy the expensive stuff others were selling without trying it first. â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €
Enter Corinne Estell. She posted in her group about samples. I commented back. She sent me samples. I tried the samples.  Fell in love with how my face felt. Ordered a regimen. Became a consultant. And changed my life. â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €
All because she sent me those samples ðŸ’™ I kid you not. All I wanted was to try it before I dropped $$$
â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €
Sound like you? Well, you're in luck. I have a bunch of samples ready to go. A plethora, if you will. Worried I'm going to annoy the shit out of you? Have no fear. That's not how I roll. â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €
Maybe you'll fall in love with great products. Maybe you'll start a new career. You won't know until you try.
