Two weeks into using the new #countertimecollection from @beautycounter and so far I’m really loving it! I’m noticing a slight difference under my eyes and overall a more “refreshed” look. I was previously using #countermatch and I really love that line but I think I might have a new favorite! Also, it just smells AMAZING!! Order tonight and get a free body butter! See my profile for the link.
