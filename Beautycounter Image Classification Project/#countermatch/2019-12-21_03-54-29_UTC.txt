I found this beauty on my front porch this week. Thanks, @beautycounter! First, how gorgeous is this packaging? With a unique gel texture and a sustainable glass bottle, this new Countermatch Hydra-Gel Radiance Toner helps minimize the appearance of pores while removing residual impurities, leaving skin hydrated and radiant. I’ve used it morning and night the past few days, and it has been wonderful for my skin in this dry, wintry air. Made without mineral oils, sulfates, and parabens, this toner has featured ingredients including:
*Squalane: derived from olives, it draws moisture into skin and visibly restores elasticity.
*Plum Oil: rich in omegas 6, 9 and vitamin E, it helps provide nutrients for vibrant, healthy-looking skin.
*Phytic Acid: sourced from rice, it gently exfoliates to aid in cell turnover, which helps skin breathe for a natural glow.
