I started using Beauty counter two years ago. I was looking for a more natural safer skin care. I started with the countermatch collection, and I was hooked. I traded all my makeup and skin care products out with Beautycounter products. I started using the countermatch collection because my skin was dry from being pregnant and the terrible midwest winter. This collection worked miracles on my face. It adapts to what your skin needs, perfect for this cold weather. I have since added other beautycounter collections to my skin care regimen, but come back to this one when I feel my skin drying out. Feel free to message me with any questions.
