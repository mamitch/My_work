In every movie marketed to teen girls (at least when I was one, I don’t know if this still rings true today), it seems that there’s always a kid-sister, who tags along and no one pays her much mind. That is until she grows up while all of her brother’s friends are away at college. They come home to find a gorgeous new face around town, and smitten, they wonder who she is.

Meet the grown-up Countermatch collection. It’s the same amazing product that was here all along — she just grew up a bit. Hello beautiful. #betterbeauty #countermatch #countermatchcollection #beautycounter #skincare #cleanbeauty
