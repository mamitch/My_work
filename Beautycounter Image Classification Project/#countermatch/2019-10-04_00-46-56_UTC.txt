It was hard for me to post this picture.. because: 1) I know it won’t vibe well in my feed 2) my eyebrows look a little crazy and 3) this square is in major need of some brightening. 
But I had to post it.. 1) as an exercise in #progressoverperfection which is a constant focus for me and 2) as an example of a #nofilter #nofoundation and still fab face. 
Since using a consistent skin care regimen, my skin’s health, evenness, hydration level, and brightness has been more even and clear and just plain lovely, really. I often hear the response, “I don’t have time for a regimen.” True or false: when you find something that works, you make time for it. And friends, this literally takes 90 seconds. 
If you still need a little extra push to dive into a skin care routine, lucky for you @beautycounter is currently offering a free Overnight Resurfacing Peel with the purchase of any collection. Oh and our collections are 10% off when purchased as a bundle. 
Hit up the first link in my bio to take a fun little quiz that’ll recommend the ideal collection for you. And swipe for a slightly brighter view of that happy happy complexion. #daaang #skincareselfcare
