The average woman puts 515 synthetic chemicals on her body daily, w/ haircare, lotion, skincare, makeup & sunscreen. 60% of what we put on our skin is absorbed into our bloodstream in minutes. If you eat organic, but still rub & spray your skin (your largest organ) w/ chemicals, you’re doing it wrong. •

It’s never too late to make the switch to a better you. Start now by clean swapping your daily products. Let me help, by introducing you to healthier options. All of our products come with a risk-free, 60-day guarantee, so if it’s not for you, we offer easy returns. When you’re ready to start, I’m your girl & I’d love to share all of Beautycounter’s lines with you! Check out all of our lines with the link in my bio. We have something for everybody in the whole family! .
