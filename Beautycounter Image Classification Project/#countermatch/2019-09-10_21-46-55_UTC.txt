Less than $0.62/day (CDN) what do you spend $0.62/day on? 
September is the new January for me. Routine starts back, school is back in session for my son and there seems to be more ğŸ’µ going out than coming in as fall activities start back up. Which can only mean my budget starts getting some much deserved attention ğŸ™ˆ 
Back in April I started taking note of how many pumps I can get out of my daily moisturizer. Iâ€™m happy to report that Iâ€™m at 102 and counting. Which means the value is even better than $0.62/day ğŸ™ŒğŸ™ŒğŸ™Œ Any guesses on what the final tally will be??? #betterbeauty #beautycounter #countermatch #bangformybuck #dailymoisturizer #facemoisturizer #value
