You don’t have to compromise safety and quality. I’m so happy @seersuckerandsaddles turned me onto @beautycounter With a commitment to ban over 1500 chemicals in their products. I’m helping drive their mission, a mission I’m so passionate about, to get safer products in the hands of everyone. Chemical free doesn’t have to be drab and non-effective. I’ve fallen in love with my skin care and make up routine!
