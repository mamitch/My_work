did you know the last time congress passed a law regulating the cosmetic industry was 1938 - y i k e s! Which is why I am over the moon about becoming a consultant for @beautycounter 
I’m sure most of you know I’ve been vegetarian for the last 2.5 years but I’ve recently shifted my focus from not just being “vegetarian” to actually trying to eat cleaner & healthier. I’ve also been doing that with my everyday products such as skin care, make up, shampoo + conditioners and household cleaners. Which is another reason why I love Beautycounter - the US only bans 30 potentially harmful cosmetic ingredients + Europe bans 1,400 - thankful we go above & beyond that and ban over 1,500 potentially harmful ingredients. Not to mention.. it only takes 26 seconds for those ingredients to make it into your bloodstream. Make c l e a n choices with me, you will not regret it! ♥️ If you’ve been interested in using safer skincare products - now is the time to make the switch! I have been having so much fun trying all of our amazing products to find the ones that best work for me.
