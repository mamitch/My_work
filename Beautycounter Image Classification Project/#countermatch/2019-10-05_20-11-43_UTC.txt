Big congratulations to our newest @beautycounter consultant, @sunniraeus 👏🏼 Loved meeting her friends and neighbors and sweet family! Sunni has been enjoying Beautycounter products for a while now, but when she realized there was a real business opportunity to partner with a brand she believed in sharing products she loves and uses, to save money and contribute to her family without sacrificing time she spends with them and on other things she is passionate about, she was all in! She’s not a salesperson. She isn’t a makeup person. And it’s all good- she has an amazing why and she has plenty of support. You did great Sunni! I can’t wait to watch your business grow! .
