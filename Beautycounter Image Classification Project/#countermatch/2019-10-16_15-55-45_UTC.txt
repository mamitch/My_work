Wednesday’s are for self-care!! I use the balancing charcoal mask every Wednesday and Sunday! ♥️ This nutrient-rich kaolin clay mask with activated charcoal purifies and balances, absorbing excess oil and drawing out impurities. Salicylic and lactic acids aid in a gentle exfoliation, giving skin a smooth, polished look with a minimized appearance of pores. Perfect for those concerned with congestion and oily skin.
