Investing in your skin, is investing in your health. 🤗

Beautycounter is lobbying in Washington to get certain ingredients banned from our conventional skincare/beauty products and are trying to increase regulation. 
We shouldn’t have to check our beauty products to make sure they are safe. The standard for beauty products should be safe and non-toxic and we can all help change that! ♥️ Order here: beautycounter.com/lexyherron
