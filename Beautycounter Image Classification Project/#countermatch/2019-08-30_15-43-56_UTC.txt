Happy Friday, Friends! ⁣
⁣
My Countertime is out on loan and it made me revisit all the other amazing products Beautycounter has to offer. ⁣
⁣
So, I’ve been using majority of the Countermatch line along with the No. 2 Plumping Oil, Charcoal Bar and Nourishing Cream Exfoliating Cleanser. 💥 ⁣
⁣
The great thing about Countermatch (my first big kid regimen in my late 30’s 🤣) is that it aides in hydration and has anti-aging properties. 💪🏻⁣
⁣
You can try out the Countermatch regimen and get a Body Butter in Citrus Mimosa for free (while supplies last) through September 3! ⁣
⁣
If you really love Citrus Mimosa... consider becoming a Band of Beauty member and get the Hydrating Lotion in the same lovely scent for free when you spend $50! ⁣
⁣
Happy Friday!⁣
