The countercontrol pore cleanser is a daily exfoliating cleanser for oily and blemish-prone skin. It effectively removes oil, makeup, and other impurities without harsh surfactants that can strip skin of moisture. The formula, featuring SkinBalance Complex and aloe vera, helps purify pores and soothe while jojoba beads gently slough away dead skin cells. Infused with an energizing citrus scent, it leaves your complexion feeling refreshed and balanced, not dry or irritated.
