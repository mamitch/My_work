Merry Christmas! GIVEAWAY #1! @lanzahaircare Keratin Healing Oil Hair Treatment & @beautycounter #countermatch Intense Moisture Serum (retail total $94)

The oil is one of my favorite products to use in the salon. It builds strength, provides flexible body & bounce, rehydrates hair so that it’s soft & silky smooth, shortens drying time, and provides high-temperature thermal & UV protection.

Packed with two forms of hyaluronic acid, plus vitamins C and E, the Intense Moisture Serum, without mineral oil or synthetic fragrance, delivers a boost of lasting hydration and antioxidant protection. With continued use, skin will feel firmer and look brighter with a more even tone. It’s lightweight, fluid texture offers easy layering.
