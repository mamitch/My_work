Excited to be sending samples to a friend who is interested in #switchingtosafer ! But I also wanted to remind everyone about @beautycounter ‘s INCREDIBLE return policy:
.
“NOT WHAT YOU EXPECTED? Beautycounter is confident that you'll love everything you purchase from us. However, if you aren't satisfied with a product for any reason, simply return the unused portion within 60 days from the ship date. We will happily refund the purchase price (excluding the original shipping and handling fees) of the returned item(s) to the original form of payment.”
.
I’m happy to send out samples, but why not give these products a try for a few days/weeks and see for yourself that clean beauty doesn’t mean compromising performance or quality? And if you are not happy, send back the USED bottles and get your money back!
