Happy Friday!! Is anyone else running around wild today and this weekend? I love hosting family and having parties but I always forget about the part where my house needs to be cleaned and making approximately 6 Kroger trips in 12 hours.

I’m so excited for this weekend and to love on my youngest niece and nephew tomorrow while we celebrating my newest (and third 😱) nephew.

My first month with Beautycounter is also closing with October (YAY 😍🤗) here next week. Just a reminder, as a thank you, every purchase within my launch month will be entered in to win a pretty sweet gift. I’m currently this 👌🏼 close to my goal! THANK YOU!!

Let me know how I can help you make the safer switch, or if you need anything from Kroger because I’m sure I’ll be there a dozen times this weekend. XOXO
