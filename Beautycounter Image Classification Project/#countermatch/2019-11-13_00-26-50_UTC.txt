SHELF REFRESH

A couple weeks ago I had the itch to change something in my room and decided to tackle my shelf. I got rid of a dozen books and then turned most of the books around so that the pages face out. (The HP series being a significant exception.) It’s amazing how this little switch really cleaned up the look of my bookshelf! 
The book pages are also making for a wonderful background to another switch I’ve been making— to cleaner skincare. @beautycounter bans 1500 harmful chemicals from all their products and are constantly looking at new research to evaluate the ingredients they do use. And their products are effective to boot!

This bookshelf has become one of my favorite parts of my space. What easy decor hacks have you used? Are you interested in cleaning up your skincare routine? (If yes, shoot me a DM or leave a comment below! ☺️) #beautycounter #betterbeauty #cleanbeauty #transparency #neverlist #countertime #countermatch #countercontrol #counterplus #harrypotter #decorhacks #bookshelf #bookshelfstyling #roomrefresh #budgetredesign
