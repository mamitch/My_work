Calling all weave students and recent weave graduates! My new studio space @oxfordweavingstudio is all set up to welcome weavers looking to create their own handwoven textiles, but who don’t have access to looms and yarn at affordable pricing. If you want to learn more, visit www.oxfordweavingstudio.com/membership as we have 4 looms available to hire by the week in our central Oxford studio. From sampling to creating your very first handwoven collection outside of uni, we’re here to help!

We’re also looking for a student familiar with setting up and designing on a Toika countermarch loom to help us make the most of our increasing demand for our handwoven products. If you have this skill, maybe you are interested in a skills swap to exchange your skill for a week of weaving on one of our looms? Get in touch via DM or at info@cassandrasabo.co.uk.
