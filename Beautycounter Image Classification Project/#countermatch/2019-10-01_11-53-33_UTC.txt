It’s my most favorite month of the year and here’s why:
💍 This month marks 5 years married to my hunky hubs
🥂 Wedding and event season takes a peek this month, which brings so much pretty designs and details
🍂 Cooler weather (maybe)
🎃 🦃 🎅🏼 It’s the kick off to all things fun and beautiful
💪🏼I’ve got some serious goals set with Beautycounter that I can wait to crush!
🧡 Hope you gave a great Tuesday and great OCTOBER!!
