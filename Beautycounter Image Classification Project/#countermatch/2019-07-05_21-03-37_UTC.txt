Happy Friday Friends!
Popping by after a morning filled with movement and playtime to let you know you can get one of my favorite safer skincare sets for *F R E E*: best-selling @beautycounter COUNTERMATCH ($88 value)!!
.
I've been using this hydrating, radiance skincare regimen for a couple weeks now and am loving the results and feel of my skin. I had been washing my face with a well-known brand and over time stopped seeing results.  My skin was looking bored, and sallow from aging and the dryness of mountain life.
.
Did you know womens skin begins to age (loss of elasticity, collagen, and hydration) around 25 years old?? Besides that being completely unfair, it made me realize how much more hydration I needed to get my glow back. Here's the details on COUNTERMATCH: 1️⃣Cleanser - removes dirt and oil without stripping skin of necessary oils that prevent rapid aging 2️⃣Intense Moisture Serum - delivers immediate and lasting hydration while providing antioxidant protection 3️⃣Adaptive Moisture Lotion - the lightweight lotion provides up to 24 hours of hydration 4️⃣Recovery Sleeping Cream - this rich night cream revitalizes skin while you sleep.
.
Today is the final day: All orders of $175+ will get a FULL travel size set of Countermatch or Countercontrol added to their cart for $0! Too good a deal to pass up!
