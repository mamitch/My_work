Sharing an update before I switch products. .
My original before pictures are from starting Beautycounters Countermatch regimen, the overnight Resurfacing Peel (every other day) and the charcoal bar soap (every other day). I ran out of the cleanser and adaptive moisture lotion and am replacing them with the new Countertime cleanser and supreme cream. . 
I encourage you to pinch and zoom! I use the front of the camera and not selfie mode to get the most detailed pictures for complete honesty.
.
I’ve been breaking out more on my chin. This could be due to several things: I’m using the overnight peel too much and irritating my skin, I’m ovulating, something in my diet, lack of sleep (yay babies!). I also pick at my whiteheads so I know that causes pimples too. Bad habits die hard.
.
Positive changes: definitely have less dry patches, skin feels less irritated, skin is way more moisturized, and it feels really good to be taking care of myself.
. 
Important note: I was crying a bunch the night before and that morning, so, that also impacted this after picture. But I start the new products tomorrow and wanted to paint a honest picture. Yay postpartum!
