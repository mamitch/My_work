Talking about cleansers today in stories. Anyone else super picky about their cleanser? I used to think that if my skin was dry + tight after I washed my face then it meant my face was actually clean. Then I found out that your skin should NOT feel like that after you wash it 😬 
Typically, that “squeaky clean” feeling means that your cleanser has probably just stripped your skin of all it’s natural oils that protect it and the ecosystem that maintains its balance. Whoops.

Some common ingredients in cleansers to be on the lookout for are: sodium lauryl sulfate, fragrance, mineral oil, parabens like propylene glycol, isopropyl alcohol, and petroleum.
These ingredients can leave your skin dry and tight, clog pores, have endocrine disrupting effects, and potentially irritate your skin. •
Thankfully, beautycounter has options. The Never List is their promise to never put harmful or questionable ingredients in their products. Instead, these products will leave your skin feeling nourished and protected, never dry or irritated. That’s the kind of squeaky clean I want 👏🏼 •
