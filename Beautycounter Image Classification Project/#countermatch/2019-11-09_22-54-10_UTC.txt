"I can't believe how long it's lasted!" A sentence I've heard from so many clients (and myself.) When you choose quality products they last longer because they aren't packed with filler ingredients. Filler ingredients are cheap so they're often added to make it seem like there is more product. This dilutes the formula and makes it less potent.

Ingredients matter! Choose clean and quality over quantity.
