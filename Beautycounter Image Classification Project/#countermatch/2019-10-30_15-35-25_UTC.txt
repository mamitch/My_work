I feel like it’s been a minute since I introduced myself. Actually I think I have only made an attempt at this 1 other time because it makes me feel a bit awkward. 🤷🏽‍♀️ but here goes...
.
I am Colby, wife, mom to two crazy (and amazing) boys. .
I teach women to take control of their eating habits by understanding food through Macros (flexible dieting). I believe food has been over complicated and there are too many of us fearing it.
.
I wrinkle my nose when I laugh or smile. And I don’t think it’s cute but my husband does and I can’t change it so I guess I better embrace it 😂.
.
I share safer beauty with everyone because I think it’s a simple way we can better our health. We fuel the inside properly but often look past the damage we can do from the outside.
.
I am multi-passionate and often struggle to focus on one thing at a time. .
I am an introvert who thrives on one-on-one conversation... aka coffee dates! ☕️ .
And I am excited to have you here following along! .
What’s 1 random fact about you?!
