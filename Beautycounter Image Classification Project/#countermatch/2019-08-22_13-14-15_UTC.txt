The U.S. only bans 30 ingredients from being used in our personal care products. The FDA website says that US law does not give it “the authority to require cosmetic manufacturers to submit safety data” so basically you are your own best advocate for safer products. Interested but not sure where to start or if you’ll like what Beautycounter has to offer? I’ll send you some samples.. just comment below and dm me your address. Countertime available as well although not pictured. #betterbeauty #weban1500 #beyourownadvocate #choosesafer #cleanbeauty #saferbeauty #counterman #countertime #countercontrol #countermatch #safeandeffective #antiaging #skincare
