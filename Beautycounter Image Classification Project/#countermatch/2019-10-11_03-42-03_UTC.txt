I can walk into the mall for socks and wind up spending $100 in 10 minutes, but when it comes to natural skincare, safer makeup, or just bettering myself I always ask "is it worth it?" YES friend you are worth it! And YES safer products for you and your family are definitely worth it! And supporting a company that advocates tirelessly for stricter laws so that ALL products can be safer for us in the future is SO worth it!

How can you become part of the better beauty movement? By reading labels and buying only safer products, by becoming a loyalty member or becoming a better beauty advocate yourself!
