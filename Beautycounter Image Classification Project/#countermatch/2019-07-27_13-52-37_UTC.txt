•Hi I’m Erika 👋🏼 I started this page mostly because I didn’t want to annoy people who were uninterested in what I had to say about BeautyCounter. With that being said, if you are in your 20’s, 30’s, 40’s and beyond, female or male, trying to live healthier or not, or  just plain human, you SHOULD be interested in what I have to say. •I haven’t always cared what I put on my body, but I have always cared about my hair and skin. The more I have educated myself over the past few years, the more I have realized how ignorant I have been. It a BIG DEAL. BeautyCounter is not just a beauty product company, it’s a movement. Did you know that the FDA doesn’t have any authority to stop companies from putting harmful chemicals in your everyday products? Harmful chemicals that have been linked to infertility and even cancer. BeautyCounter is an advocate for getting safer products in the hands of everyone. •I don’t want to sell things. That’s not what this is, so don’t be alarmed. I want to educate, and introduce to you and others a company who sells high quality products that are SAFE. That’s one less thing to worry about right? I want to be a resource. I want people to be aware of the kind of toxins and hormone disruptors that are in your current products, that are living in your homes, and that you are actively putting on the largest organ of your body - your skin. •My journey is just beginning and I don’t know it all. But I’ve found a company who’s values align with mine and I want to share that! 💄💋
