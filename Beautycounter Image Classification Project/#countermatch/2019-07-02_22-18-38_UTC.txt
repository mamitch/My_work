Hey 👋🏼 .
I’m Charity! I’m the face behind @essentiallycharity .
In this photo I’m wearing the Flawless in Five. I’m not a makeup artist, but I don’t feel like I need to be with this makeup line. It’s safer for your skin which is why I chose to #switchtosafer. Why is it called the #flawlessinfive ? Because you can apply the makeup in five minutes or less! .
.
Beauty doesn’t need to consume your whole day. Makeup shouldn’t look or feel cakey and gross. It should look natural! It should feel like you’re just wearing your skin! That’s what this makeup feels like! I’ve been wearing for months now and I LOVE it! It’s made a huge difference! .
.
What about pimples?? Well, when you’re using safer and cleaner products, your skin isn’t clogged up as much. I’ve never seen my face with so few pimples! Like ever! .
