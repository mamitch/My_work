If you put something ON your body, it is IN your body. It takes less than 30 seconds for ingredients to be absorbed into your blood stream, which makes it even more important to choose safer, good for you ingredients. While there are a lot of things we can switch to safer, I think it's most important to START with what you use the most! These are your cleansers, moisturizers, sunscreens, body wash and lotion. 
Beautycounter has two lotions to choose from. The Countermatch Adaptive Body Moisturizer gives advanced hydration to relieve dryness, dullness and uneven texture with the same Bio-Mimic technology that adapts with your skin as the Countermatch Skin Care. 
BONUS: Get this for free as a Host Reward when you host a Social in August or September. Message me if you are interested! 
The Hydrating Body Lotion is lightweight and fast-absorbing, perfect for everyday with a refreshing citrus scent. 
BONUS: Pairs perfectly with the Body Wash, also with the Citrus Mimosa scent!
