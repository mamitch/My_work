Iâ€™ve never had perfect skin, nor will I ever. BUT, this last year of switching to #beautycounter I have seen a dramatic change in my skin... Fewer breakouts, significantly less dry skin, smaller and less noticeable pores, I could go on forever. The bottom line is that my skin feels and looks better because I am taking better care of it... Between better sunscreen application and #saferskincare I feel more confident than ever in the skin Iâ€™m in. Iâ€™d LðŸ–¤VE to help you feel the same...
