As much as I love Colorado, I have no idea how my skin and lips would survive without humidity ðŸ˜…

When it comes to skincare, I mix and match a lot of my products to meet my skinâ€™s different needs. I can have hormonal breakouts around my chin, an oily T-zone, while my cheeks are as dry as a desert. Thatâ€™s why I love Countermatch. Itâ€™s perfect for my complicated combination skin. It hydrates where I need it and the Adaptive Moisturizer actually has salicylic acid that evens skin tone and is perfect for people, like me, who have acne prone skin! 
Itâ€™s all a balancing act, so pay attention to your skin and see what your needs are. Take the skin quiz on Beautycounterâ€™s website to see what regimen it recommends for you OR let me help you find something that will work perfectly for you!
