✨My beach time ESSENTIALS✨ .
No matter what my diet is or how much sun I’ve gotten, these babies come through for me !!! I literally would not go to the beach without these items (and 1 more supplement that I’ll share later). These help keep my body and my skin alive and well !!
.
1. Spirulina: a powerful algae that helps filter out nasty chemicals in your blood ! 
2. Countersun Gel:  With aloe and California poppy extract, it cools on contact to help soothe skin post UV exposure and boost hydration—safely. (and its monoi scent is like a vacation in a bottle).
3. My GF (gluten free) multivitamin which has almost every amazing nutrient squeezed into a single vitamin. I feel SO good when I take this daily!
4. Travel size Cleansing Balm: Beautycounter’s best seller and hands down my fav product 🙌🏻. Packed with Vitamin C, cranberry and raspberry seed oil it’s a cleanser and moisturizer in ONE and my skin craves it after a salty sunny day at the beach. 
5. Code Age Probiotics: I take this morning and night especially when my diet is not the norm and i’m traveling ! It helps digestion for me a lot! It’s a new type of probiotic that is soil born and derived with turmeric and other ingredients that help your body absorb the probiotics. 
6. And last but not least, my FAVORITE FACE LOTION, a travel-sized Countermatch Adaptive Day cream 🙌🏻It’s lightweight, smooth as silk, and the best part is that it is for ALL SKIN TYPES bc it ADAPTS to each persons optimum hydration level. So if your skin is oily one day it adapts. If it’s dry, it will add even more moisture. It’s the newest technology in the skincare Industry called “BioMimicking Technology” and it adapts to each persons skin 😱😱😱. .
.
I’m definitely a minimalist when I head to the beach bc I have so many other little people to think about and these items give me the biggest bang for my time away 🎉🙌🏻. .
