helloooooo T O N E R. just (officially) launched today is our new countermatch collection which includes toner! As previously shared, I am a #countermatch lover, and have been since day one. I can’t wait to start using this collection again, with the addition of the prep. step! A few things to note.... ✨all of the new countermatch products are being offered today only @ 15% off ✨countermatch’s new packaging is part of @beautycounter ‘s new packaging initiative - hellloooo good sustainability efforts!

About the toner specifically: ✨gel textured, and will provide your skin with the hydration and nutrition it needs while obviously removing any impurities left on the skin
✨one of the key ingredients is 
S Q U A L E N E which I’ve learned specifically mimics your skin’s natural oils, is a natural antioxidant and because of its anti-tumour properties; it protects from carcinogens. 
Happy toning, (and shopping!) everyone. ❤️ .
