I'm obsessed with my skin! I feel weird saying that, but it's true. I've been using #Countertime exclusively for the last couple months. I didn't want to leave #Countermatch-- I loved it so much! It's just something about that #RetinaturalComplex.⁣⁣

My skin is smooth, practically poreless, and radiant. I rarely wear foundation, but I always dolled myself up for date night.⁣⁣

Well, for the first time ever, I went on date night with bare skin. I did my brows, put on a soft pink Color Intense lip, bunned the curls, and headed to the theater. Completely confident that I looked aiiight for a mom of 5 running on 4 hours of sleep. 😆⁣⁣

THANKS, @Beautycounter!⁣⁣

SN: When did I become obsessed with funky wallpaper?! And why are they only in the restrooms of cool bars/restaurants? 🤷🏽‍♀️⁣⁣
