My favorite Body Moisturizers for summer are definitely the Countermatch Adaptive Body Moisturizer and Melting Body Balm from @beautycounter. ⁣
⁣
Our Countermatch Adaptive Body Moisturizer is light yet super rich. It penetrates the skin giving 24-hours of hydration without any⁣
stickiness. It relieves dullness, dryness, and uneven texture. It has a light almond scent that I LOVE.⁣
⁣
Why is it safer? The skin is our largest organ. Therefore, body lotions offer the most exposure to potentially toxic ingredients, like mineral oil and PEGs. Our Countermatch Adaptive Body Moisturizer is free from PEGs (ethoxylated emulsifiers), synthetic fragrances,⁣
mineral oils, and silicones and instead uses 100% naturally derived ingredients to nourish skin.⁣
⁣
⁣
Our Melting Body Balm is rich and luxurious, with a scent that is to die for. It's also a multi tasker. Aside from using it as a body moisturizer, I also use it on my cuticles, elbows, and even on my hair flyaways! It comes out like a balm, melts into an oil, and dries without any residue.⁣
⁣
Why is it safer? Melting Body Balm is formulated without polyethylene glycols, widely used as thickeners and moisture-carriers, which can be⁣ contaminated with potentially harmful compounds like ethylene oxide and 1,4-dioxane. Instead we have formulated this hydrating balm with⁣ natural thickeners— plant-derived waxes like carnauba and rhus⁣ verniciflua peel. Plus, a combination of plant-derived oils provides skin-conditioning benefits.⁣
