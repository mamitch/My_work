As promised, here is a list and explanation of the products that I use daily! I like to mix and match a bit 🤣

Morning Routine: 
Face wash- I alternate between these two products.. (pic #1)
🍃 Countercontrol Clear Pore Cleaner & 🍃 Cleansing Balm (I use this more often in the drier months to help prevent dry skin)

Followed by ... (pic #2)
🍃Countermatch Intense Moisture Serum, 🍃Countermatch Eye Rescue cream, 🍃2 drops of the Facial Oil No. 1 with the Countermatch Adaptive lotion. (If I feel my face getting dry during the changing season, I’ll add a drop or two more of the oil). Evening Routine: 
Facewash - again, I alternate between these two products..
🍃 Countercontrol Clear Pore Cleaner & 🍃 Cleansing Balm 🍁Every other night I apply the Overnight Resurfacing Peel and wait 5 mins before applying my creams. 
I use the ... (pic #3)
🍃 Countermatch Intense Moisture Serum, 🍃 Countermatch Eye Rescue Cream followed by 🍃 2 drops of the Facial Oil No. 1 combined with the Countermatch Recovery Sleeping Cream.

I love the Flawless in 5 set!! It includes...
🍃 Dew Skin Tinted Moisturizer with SPF 20 (or Tint Skin Hydrating Foundation)
🍃Concealer Pen
🍃Mascara (Lengthening or Volumizing)
🍃Lip Gloss (12 colours to choose from)
🍃Brilliant Brow Gel (or Pencil)
🍃Satin Powder Blush (7 colours to choose from)

But I also add
🍃 Matifying Powder (for those days my skin looks a bit shiny)
🍃 Illuminating Cream Bronzer (I like the glow it gives in the summer months)

Did I introduce these products all at once? Absolutely not! I did a gradual switch to let my skin adjust and so that I didn’t spend a ton of money all at once. I often waited for sales or specials before purchasing new products;) #betterbeauty #saferbeautycanada #saferbeautyproducts #beautycounter #facialoils #rountine #bossmama #boymama #tiredmama #hustling #dailyporecleanser #cleansingbalm #flawlessin5 #mixandmatch #countermatch #countercontrol
