Recently, I have been frequently told I have beautiful skin and asked what’s my secret? Is it... genetics? Staying hydrated? My pregnancy glow? ⁣
⁣
My answer is all of the above plus my skincare regimen. For the past four years I have been using @beautycounter. ⁣
⁣
Beautycounter is a company with a mission of getting safer products into everyone’s hands. They have a #neverlist which prohibits the use of over 1500 harmful or potentially harmful ingredients from all of their products (compared to the US which only band 30 🙀). ⁣
⁣
Currently, my go to routine is the #Countermatch regimen. It uses a breakthrough Bio-Mimic Technology to continually provide moisture to my skin all day which is perfect for my dry skin. Making the switch to safer beauty products has truly paid off!!!⁣
