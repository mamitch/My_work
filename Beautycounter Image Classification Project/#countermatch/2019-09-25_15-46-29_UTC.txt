Tint skin foundation is a lightweight, creamy foundation that actually cares for your skin. 
This formula goes on seamlessly and blends effortlessly to cover imperfections and visually even out skin tone. It’s buildable and natural-looking, and leaves you in control of the coverage: For light coverage, apply with the Retractable Foundation Brush; for medium coverage, apply with the Flat Complexion Brush. 
It comes in 10 flexible shades, each of which is formulated to suit a range of skin tones. (So you don’t necessarily have to change shades as the seasons change.) It also includes sodium hyaluronate, a natural moisture magnet, to promote smoother-looking skin and reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.
