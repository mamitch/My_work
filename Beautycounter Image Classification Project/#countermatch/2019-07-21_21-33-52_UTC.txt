Took these three products on our camping, well “glamping” trip. We stayed in a tent structure at Huttopia which is as close to camping as I will get 😂 A travel/sample of cleansing balm for washing my face at night, countermatch adaptive moisture lotion for night and morning moisturizing and a bit of dew skin for SPF and a little coverage. That’s it! I do love the new countertime line, but these are still my skincare go-to’s especially for travel 💚 #saferbeauty #betterbeauty #beautycounter @beautycounter #countermatch #countertime #cleanbeauty #glamping
