my skin has been so off lately! im grateful to have great skin for the most part, but I’m realizing that it changes so much more than it used to. having a baby has changed it, hormones have changed it, stress and lack of sleep has changed it. i can really tell when I’ve been eating too much sugar before bed (oops 😩), not listening to my body to take care of myself and when my hormones fluctuate. that being said I’ve also realized that my skin needs different treatment depending on the weather and change of season.

I’ve been a #countermatch lover since I first started using @beautycounter ’s products, but I’ve changed things up a bit and I thought I’d share that with you all! Here is the current line up!
•
✨#countercontrol ‘s clear pore cleanser (in the AM) to clear the random (more than usual) breakouts I’ve been experiencing
✨charcoal cleansing bar before bed (in conjunction with the clear pore cleanser)
✨#countertime ‘s soft cream (AM)
✨#countertime ‘s eye cream and supreme cream (PM)
✨overnight resurfacing peel to keep me lookin’ as young and rested as possible - aka Botox in a bottle (every other night)
✨charcoal mask for balance, exfoliation, purification (once a week)

Both cleansers have pretty much cleared my skin within DAYS (seriously!) and all the #countertime has worked wonders on how dry my skin has been due to the change in temperature. The peel is usual programming 😂, and so is the mask! I would never think to mix up collections, and I’m so glad that I have. Thank you @knowbetterlife for suggesting this! 🙋🏻‍♀️ .
