#nofilter #nomakeup 🤗 Just an Overnight Resurfacing Peel + Countertime/Countermatch glow and a clingy toddler made happier in his @wildbird 🥰 #wewokeuplikethis .

Loving how my skin has responded to the few Countertime products I introduced about a month ago. I chose to slowly introduce our new anti-aging line because anything “anti-aging” I’ve used in the past has not gone well for my super sensitive, easily dried out, skin. I’ve been using the Countertime Cleansing Oil + Hydrating Essence with Countermatch Eye Rescue Cream and Adaptive Moisturizer. I’ve noticed I need less moisturizer (even skipping my beloved Facial oil #1 and only using it because I just love it), and my skin is softer, more even, and just so glowing! And it’s all pregnancy and nursing safe! 🤗 .

Just an example of how @beautycounter has something for everyone and you don’t have to switch EVERYTHING right away or even go all in on a regimen! We can customize it and find what will make sense for your skin! I’d love to help! 🤗
