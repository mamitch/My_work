I don’t know about you but I tend to forget to put on masks. I just started keeping my charcoal mask in the shower so I can remember and I’ve been successfully remembering to do it when I feel I need it. It’s great for pulling the bad out of your pores and leaving it looking oh so good and refreshed. Don’t forget our promo too where you can get a free countercontrol (our acne line) it a free Countermatch (our combination skin line) travel set when you spend $175.
