No makeup Monday - more like no makeup everyday 😆 .
.
The long weekend was so nice to spend time with the family and friends. Hosting, cooking, and doing all the things that comes with it - cleaning (before, during, after). For some reason, this year I didn’t even bother putting on a full face of makeup, I just felt...comfortable. That’s so odd when you think about it. We should feel comfortable and confident in our own skin but it’s often rarely the case. .

What’s my secret? My skincare regimen 👏 👏 👏 .
.
My go to skincare products got a new look and are on sale today only for cyber Monday! - see stories or message me for the details. .
.
In my 20s I didn’t prioritize my skincare needs, now In my 30s I’m working to reverse the damage done. It’s a slow journey but I have made a commitment, love the results, and am never looking back. .
