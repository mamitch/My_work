Why I have this passion of safer skincare...I was diagnosed 6 years ago with breast cancer, that was estrogen positive. I took a look at all aspects of my life and started choosing things that were good for total body health. I stumbled upon @danettemay for a new lifestyle, love her and her programs! Then @ beauthcounter which has become a passion of mine! I'm not a seller.....I just love being part of something that is helping women use safer products on themselves and families. Also, working to get laws past to eliminate harmful ingredients in skincare
...................
If you don't know this already some skincare products carry harmful ingredients. Such as parabens, phalates, Oxybenzone etc. For my health, I wanted to eliminate as much of these unhealthy ingredients as possible. I tried various products but was not happy until I tried Beautycounter products. They are products that just don't claim to work they do! .....................
Why I love this company:
-Transparency on their products
-The never list 1500 questionable chemicals  they prohibit from being used
-Working for regulatory laws to eliminate  harmful and questionable ingredients in  skincare
-Education to everyone on safe skincare

I love this safe skincare movement and love being a part of this for myself, family and friends. If you already use safe skincare that is great! If you don't..... check out Beautycounter products. I have joined this company to educate my friends on healthier alternatives!
