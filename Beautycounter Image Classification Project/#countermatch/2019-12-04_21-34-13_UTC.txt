Today is a huge day. Beautycounter’s CEO @greggrenfrew was invited to speak at a congressional hearing as an expert witness on why we need updated regulation over the personal care industry. The existing regulation hasn’t been updated since 1938. ⁣
⁣
Beautycounter has gone above and beyond since day one but we also fight to make sure ALL products are safe - not just ours. That’s using our voices for good and I’m DAMN PROUD to be part of it. The picture above is me using my voice speaking about these exact issues with a KY Congressman earlier this year. ⁣
