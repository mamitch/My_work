We only get one skin so love it well by taking good care of it! Here are a few reasons to have a daily routine. No, it's not just a way to get you to consume more products! ðŸ”¹Skin sheds daily -- healthy skin now doesn't mean healthy skin later. Without caring for it daily, our skin will become dull overtime. ðŸ”¹Everyone's skin is different -- what works for one person probably won't work for you. Reach out to me if you aren't sure what's best and I can help you! ðŸ”¹Beautiful skin takes time -- the choices you are making now impact how your skin will be in a few years. Are you helping or harming your future skin? ðŸ”¹Prevention -- By investing in a few high performing products now, you are saving yourself from more drastic measures later on. ðŸ”¹Save money -- I know $50 may seem overpriced for a moisturizer (I've been there), but putting my money towards products that work has eliminated expensive appointments and prescriptions AND they are SAFER! ðŸ”¹One positive change leads to another -- Taking good care of our skin is just one step in caring well for our whole body. Starting here will motivate you to make better choices in other areas of self-care. 
Want to try out a routine? Comment below, and I'll send you samples! @beautycounter has several skincare collections designed to meet different skin's needs. I recommend at least starting with a cleanser and moisturizer, then add in the additional steps if you can't do it all at once. The collections are designed to be used together for best results since each product has a specific purpose.
