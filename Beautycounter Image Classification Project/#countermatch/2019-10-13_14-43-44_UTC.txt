Self-care Sunday🤗 How about a little self-care everyday, starting with your skin?! Y’all know how much I love @beautycounter products! Last week I finally took the plunge and decided to try some of their new #countertime line. After 5 days, I’m obsessed!! The pictures don’t do justice for this line. Even my hubby noticed a difference 😍

So what’s so special about the #countertime line? Well, it’s perfect for all the Retinol lovers out there! It’s a plant derived product that’s similar to retinol, without the harsh side effects. •
Don’t want to stick to just one line?? You don’t have to! Mix it up! I use pieces from the #countercontrol #countermatch and #counter+ lines too! I get to personalize my skincare routine for what works best for my skin, plus the overnight resurfacing peel (my fav❤️). •
Ready to make the #cleanswap and try something different? I’d love to help you! #Beautycounter  has been a game changer for me, and lots of friends and family too🤗  #selfcare #skincare #saferbeauty #saferskincare
