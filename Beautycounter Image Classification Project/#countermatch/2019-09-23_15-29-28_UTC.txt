I have fallen in love with the Sheer Lipsticks! 
This silky-smooth and ultra-moisturizing formula gives lips a sheer wash of color and a touch of polished sheen. It also includes jojoba esters and carnauba was to condition and hydrate lips and no synthetic fragrance - just a sophisticated hint of natural vanilla. The shade range is designed to compliment all skin tones, and the formula is super buildable - layer it on to intensify the color, it try it under lip gloss for a more lustrous look.
