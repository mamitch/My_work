The classic palette is so pretty!! Flattering to all skin tones, it features nine safer shades in matte and satin finishes, including a sparkling topper shade to take your look from day to night.

Beautycounter’s eyeshadow formula is specially designed for rich color payoff and long-wearing performance, without the questionable ingredients. It’s triple-milled to a precise, silky-smooth consistency and formulated with Butterpowder – an ingredient that boosts pigment and long-wear – so it lays down evenly and blends seamlessly. 
AND it Includes a removable mirror!! 😍
