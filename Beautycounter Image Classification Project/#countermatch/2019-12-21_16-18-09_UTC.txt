So, a moment of crazy ideas as we headed into break... I taught my classes as the Grinch yesterday. No, @beautycounter doesn’t have face paint (hmmm), so I had green hairspray and Halloween paints to deal with.
Well, the @beautycounter #instanteyemakeupremover? Worked not only near my eyes but got the cheap waterproof eyeliner black easily. Then the #charcoalfacialmask got my pores a lot cleaner than probable before the paint, and the #mimosabodybar actually got most of the green out of my scalp in my buzzed part of hair (actually, it lathered enough it could be a shampoo for hair like mine... who knew?) Add the #countermatch adaptive lotion and peppermint #lipconditioner... my face felt back to normal! And the next day? No breakouts!!! Added bonus? There is a big sale on the site right now. If you’re even remotely interested, take a peak. It won’t be here for Christmas, but pampering between Christmas and the new year (or Ukrainian Christmas) doesn’t sound bad either! https://www.beautycounter.com/alipeters
