Facial oils. Which one do you need? ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
1️⃣ brightens skin, evens tone, hydration⁣⁣
2️⃣ hydrates, fights wrinkles, pores, and “plump” skin ⁣⁣
3️⃣ balances oily, breakout prone skin, while reducing redness ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
I regularly use #1 but my skin lately has been NUTS. My pores are going through something personal and the redness in my skin is something fierce. I probably need a mixture of all three. I wish they had some sort of trial size collection.. ⁣⁣

Stay tuned for our holiday collection of this mini oil collection + SO much more. 🎄😉
