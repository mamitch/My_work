Our family has been so blessed to have Ms Lesley as a daycare provider for Logan. Now she has blessed me with this sweet review of the Countermatch eye cream. I did not ask her to do this but she told me she was seeing results and she wanted to share so other people could benefit from these amazing products. ♥️”Hi! I am Lesley & this week I’ve tried Beautycounter Countermatch eye cream. I’ve tried L’Oréal, Olay & Garnier Eye creams with little to no results. I teach preschool at 6 in the morning & try to have a social life; 30 is starting to show age & Eye wrinkles: suffice to say a dependable eye cream is essential! Nerium worked for me but at $90 a bottle it is outrageously out of my price range! Not to mention, I have zero idea what’s in it! I have nieces that I try to keep safe & we are trying to conceive so extra chemicals or hormones are seriously a no no! I am emotional enough! We are very conscientious about what we put into our bodies, so why has it taken this long for me to peak an interest in what I put on my face! Besides the organic aspect, I love buying from someone I know! Leah never pressures anyone I know into buying (I’m looking at you Mary Kay guilt trippers) Leah gives all the resources and information she has according to what YOU want, no more, no less. I know how much she loves her little family & I believe she wants just as much goodness for my family. Why would you not support her?! Win win, win.. attached are my results after only one week. Form your own opinions but I am absolutely feeling brighter & fresher faced! And you only need less than a pea sized amount each day! Absolutely worth investing in your own self! I will definitely be buying again!”♥️ I cannot thank her enough for the sweet words. She is such a great person, inside and out. Thank you for supporting my family by purchasing Beautycounter. 🙌🏻😍 #bossmama #countermatch #saferbeauty #beauty
