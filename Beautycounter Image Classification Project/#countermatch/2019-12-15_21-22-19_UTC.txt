I used to have dry, cracked, old granny hands that hurt year round but the winters were the WORST.  I would sleep with lotion and plastic gloves on and nothing would help. After I had littles I washed my hands more frequently and everytime I washed them my hands would burn. My hands improved immediately when I switched my lotion to Beautycounterâ€™s Countermatch Adaptive moisture body lotion !! I used it very very sporadically and my hands stopped hurting right away and within a couple of weeks they looked so much younger!! Also, Olivia has TERRIBLE keratosis pilaris and it itches so badly but this lotion makes it go away when it flares. Obsessed with it because it drys almost instantly and that is priceless when you are busy with your kids ðŸ¤£ this is definitely a great Christmas gift for yourself or someone else. Tomorrow is the last day to order with standard shipping to receive it by Christmas Eve!!! Link in my bio to order please message me if you have any questions.
