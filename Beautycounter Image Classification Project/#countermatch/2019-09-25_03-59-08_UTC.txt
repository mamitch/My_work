Product tip Tuesday!! The importance of using a serum

What is serum?
A serum is an essential skincare product step that you can apply to your skin after cleansing before your moisturizer to deliver powerful active ingredients. Serum is made up of smaller molecules that can penetrate deeply into the layers of the skin and provide a very high concentration of these active ingredients. This makes a serum a great tool for targeting specific skincare concerns.

Is serum a moisturizer?
Yes and no. Serums can contain moisturizing ingredients to help the skin retain its natural moisture or add more to skin that lacks. That still doesn't make them a moisturizer because face lotions and creams are made up differently and provide a barrier on the surface of the skin to keep all of the actives in place that were applied before.

How often should I use my serum?
This depends on the serum. Follow the instructions on the label and you will get your best results.

What's the difference between serum and face oil?
Serums are generally water-based but face oils tend to be marketed as "serums" making it a bit confusing. There are water-based serums and oil-based serums. Water-based serums are applied under the cream/lotion moisturizer and they nourish the inner layer of the skin due to the fact that the molecules are very small to allow deeper penetration of the product actives. Oil-based serums are applied on top of the moisturizer because they are made up of larger molecules. They're formulated to lock in moisturizer and whatever else was applied in the previous steps of the regimen (amazing for dry skin or to create a barrier in the cold winter months). So have fun with our Beautycounter selections and donâ€™t forget to re-evaluate your skin care needs as the season change!
