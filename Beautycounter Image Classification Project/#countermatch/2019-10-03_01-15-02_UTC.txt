Purchasing a skin-care collection is the easiest way to #switchtosafer and see your skin improve! These collections are an investment, but in the same way we invest in healthy food and gym memberships, choosing safer, high-performing products is another important choice in caring well for our bodies. Plus, from personal experience they last several months so the cost over time is very affordable. 
We have a quick and easy QUIZ you can take to determine which collection is best for you! Comment below your results and I will choose one person who also purchases their specific Collection to get FREE SHIPPING! And through October 6, get a FREE Overnight Resurfacing Peel as a gift with purchase with any collection! Our Collections included an automatic $15-$42 savings plus the $63 value of the Peel!
