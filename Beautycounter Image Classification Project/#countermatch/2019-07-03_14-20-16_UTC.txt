When itâ€™s ridiculously windy, you go with the beach wave vibe... as much as a longer undercut bob will allow... The @beautycounter #brilliantbrowgel in neutral beige, #colorintenselipstick in First Date; #volumizingmascara;  hint of Slate #necessaryneutralspalette #eyeshadow.
And? Felt good and looked good long past the play! 7 hours of no fading/clumping/irritating (and my face screams sensitive with makeup). No foundation/tinted moisturizer today. #countermatch adaptive lotion that I wear daily. 
May the wind not blow you away today, and your face feel beautiful so you feel that way - makeup or no makeup! #beautycountercanada
