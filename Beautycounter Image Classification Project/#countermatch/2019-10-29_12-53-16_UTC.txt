This morning I looked in the mirror and was thought, this is the best you can do? I legit almost teared up but heard Brinley waking up. My hair is so greasy I could fry an egg, my jeans were too tight so I opted for leggings, and I just felt BLEH. Then Michael gave me extra kisses this morning, Brinley was saying “mama” from her crib, and I perked up.

I was listened to a podcast from @greggrenfrew and her words cut through me. She said “woman always feel this pressure to be perfect 100% of the time. Perfect mom, wife, hair, outfit, employee, and that’s unrealistic.” When did we get so hard on OURSELVES. Michael and Brin don’t care what my hair is like or that I’m in leggings. Gregg said, “we have to empower our daughters to have confidence every single day even when they are feeling low on themselves. We have to tell them, you’ve got this girl, you can do it.” And just then I thought, wow. I hope Brin didn’t recognize the lack of confidence I had for myself this morning, because honestly I’m uber proud of myself.

So yeh, long ramble in short...
1. We aren’t perfect, so let’s not try to act like it. Let’s be real. We’re human. Let’s remember that and be kind to ourselves and to each other.
2. You’ve got this... this day, this job, this whatever you need, you’ve got it!!!
3. Be confident in yourself. Impress the 6 year old you and 60 year old you!
