A little dab’ll do ya! I’m applying the Countermatch skin care collection over in my stories today (saved to the Countermatch highlight bubble.) Come see the step-by-step of this adaptive moisturizing set. Perfect for normal/low maintenance skin.

I love that the pumps on this collection are pre-measured so you don’t waste product. And, because @beautycounter doesn’t use any unnecessary fillers, you don’t need much of each product for it to do its job. 🙌🏼
