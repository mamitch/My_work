YOU’RE INVITED! 
Last year I hosted a Holiday Pop Up Shop & it was an absolute blast!!!! I love having all of you over and chatting about a safer lifestyle, showcasing Beautycounter’s beautiful products and getting some girl time in!!! It’s such a fun way to thank each of you for being such a huge supporter in my small business and in Beautycounter’s all over mission! 
Saying thank you just isn’t enough! So let’s celebrate!
