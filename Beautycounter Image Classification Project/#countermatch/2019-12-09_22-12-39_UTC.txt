My last 5 business coaching clients hit director a month later or that same oneðŸ˜±

The good news is that this could be you tooðŸ˜‰

You don't have to be a blogger or have a swipe up link to get there

You also don't have to send 30 DM's to people you haven't talked to in years that you hate doing

You don't have to build your business in a cookie cutter cold pitch way

Your business could feel fun

It could actually feel like the creative outlet you originally intended to create

Your content creation doesn't have to feel so scattered and random and a source of stress for you every week

My Boss Up Your Biz coaching sessions are now open for December

A 1 hour business and mindset intensive to take you from stuck senior consultant or frustrated manager to director

You don't need another free download on Instagram strategy that you're not going to use anyways becuase you need clarity and confidence first

You've had your eye on working with me for a while but you keep telling yourself "next time"

The thing is, that "when it's the right time" attitude you have is the reason you're still in the same spot

You've spent more time debating on hiring me and price shopping in my DM's when you could be using it to grow your business

2020 could be your best year ever

If you step up now

DM me right now to apply! .
