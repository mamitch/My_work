A little update here:

Been using my travel sized Countermatch regimen (+ charcoal bar every other day + overnight peel every other day + castor oil on eyelashes at night when I remember and Shea butter on lips as moisturizer) for almost two weeks and have been noticing some changes. 
Skin is softer: my dry patches feel less dry and there are less of them. 
My toddler asked what the lines of my forehead were while we were playing, lol, so no impact on wrinkles. 
My chin is my problem area in terms of acne.  In general it feels less rough (clogged pore rough, hope I’m explaining that right), but seems like my skin is pushing more stuff out - so not angry red pimples, but small bumps that heal up within a couple of days. 
Ill continue using until it’s all out! Not sure if I’ll stick with countermatch, but it’s way better than what I was doing before.  My skin was very dry and irritated feeling when I’m comparing.
