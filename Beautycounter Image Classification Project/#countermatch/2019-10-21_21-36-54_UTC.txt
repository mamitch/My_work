Soooo I just did a thing. I signed up for my first holiday vendor fair to spread the mission and products of @beautycounter and I’m so excited!! More info to come. But mark your calendar for November 9th! BUT I NEED YOUR ADVICE! Would you be okay with ordering products or would you rather have them in your hands that day? I mean... when you order them and get them shipped to you it’s like a surprise all over! Right?? I may even wrap them for you! 🎁
