Although I had heard nothing but positive remarks about Beautycounter before trying it, I was still hesitant because it can be an investment, and let’s be real, I’m sometimes cheap🤷‍♀️☺️ SO. I’m offering some samples to three people that haven’t tried BC before but have been interested in a safer skincare regimen.
🌿If you’re wanting to give it a try, send me a DM or text to let me know, then simply click on the “Skincare Quiz” link in my bio and answer the questions.
🌿Message me your results- that’s it! Feel free to ask any questions (I was kind of in between two regimens because I had oily probe skin but also wanted anti-aging benefits).
🌿Here’s a quick breakdown of each line:
•COUNTERCONTROL- for blemish/oily prone skin
•COUNTERMATCH- for normal skin needing extra hydration
•COUNTERTIME- for mature/dry skin needing an anti-aging, safe retinol alternative
