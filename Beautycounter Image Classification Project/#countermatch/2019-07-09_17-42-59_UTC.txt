Today’s the day! Countertime is officially here. Now you can safely turn back time. Beautycounter's new plant-based anti-aging line, that is a safe alternative to retinol!! Countertime was 3 years in the making and was developed to visibly reverse the signs of aging and deliver high performance results, thanks to our innovative Retinatural Complex. Note: it’s safe to use during pregnancy, unlike retinol. And can we just talk about how pretty the pink glass packaging is!! No more plastic. It’s all sustainable packaging now. You can check it all out for yourself with the link up above in my profile! .
