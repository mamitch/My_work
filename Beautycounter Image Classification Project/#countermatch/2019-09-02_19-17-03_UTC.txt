My skin has been a bit bonkers since I’ve had this annoying summer cold (that I’ve successfully passed around the house) and strep throat (plus all the junk I’ve been eating this weekend) BUT I’m treating myself to mask, some me time, and prepping for a great week. It’s finally September PTL and although my favorite time of year is approaching, it’s also my most stressful time. So #beautycounter to the rescue with all things balancing and purifying! My skin my be the only thing balanced this season. •••
