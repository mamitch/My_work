Being a part of the #betterbeauty revolution is about more than just clean, high-performing products, itâ€™s about using our voices and combining our energies to stand up for the cause and help make ACTUAL changes in legislature by having conversations with law makers around the US & Canada. And you wonder who does that? Itâ€™s consultants like myself and my team and teams all around.

One of the main reasons that I was attracted to @beautycounter is that as a @bcorporation we care about people & planet as much as we care about running a profitable business. As my side hustle has been growing, I have been so excited about reaching higher goals and titles each month by sharing our mission with more people who are excited to live their best life and growing a team of motivated consultants who want to make a difference in the beauty industry.
