Last week I got to pop in to the Denver @beautycounter ! If you are in the area, check it out, you can shop with me while you’re there and they will help you find the perfect fit for your skin care or makeup. My favorite thing I got was the Countermatch Discovery set because I can’t wait to share it with y’all! I’ve been using this line for a year and my skin has never felt better! It’s ready to go, local friends who who wants it first for a couple nights?! Not local? I have samples I’d be happy to drop in the mail for you! Leave a 🙋🏼‍♀️ below!
