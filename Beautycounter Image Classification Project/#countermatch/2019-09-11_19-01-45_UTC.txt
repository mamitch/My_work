Powered by Bio-Mimic Technology, each product harnesses the unique life-giving properties of plants to match the composition of skin, giving it precisely what it needs and nothing it doesn't. ðŸŒ¾Pure Calm Cleansing Milk: ultra-gentle cleanser that removes makeup and impurities without surfactants that can strip away natural oils. Its conditioning formula respects skinâ€™s balance, replenishing essential hydration so skin feels soft and nourished, never dry or tight. ðŸŒ¾Intense Moisture Serum: Delivers a concentrated boost of moisture for immediate and lasting hydration, while vitamins C (ascorbic acid) and E (tocopherol) provide antioxidant protection. ðŸŒ¾Eye Rescue Cream: Formulated for the delicate eye area, this nourishing cream awakens eyes by helping to reduce the appearance of shadows for brighter-looking eyes. ðŸŒ¾Adaptive Moisture Lotion: Helps skin adapt to the ever-changing aggressors of modern life by adjusting hydration and oxygenation levels throughout the day. This lightweight lotion hydrates skin throughout the day to provide up to 24 hours of hydration. ðŸŒ¾Recovery Sleeping Cream: With an advanced blend of hyaluronic acid, plum oil (Prunus Domestica Seed Extract), and tara gum (Caesalpinia Spinosa Gum), this rich cream creates a protective layer to shield skin from moisture loss, replenishing hydration and revitalizing skin while you sleep.
