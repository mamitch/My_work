Beautycounter screens every single ingredient for safety by reviewing the scientific literature and commissioning studies where data is lacking. They test every batch of color cosmetics THREE TIMES for heavy metal contamination (did you know “natural” makeup, like mineral makeup, is at risk for high metals contamination?) They’re transparent about every ingredient they use and why. And even better? They use active ingredients that work.
