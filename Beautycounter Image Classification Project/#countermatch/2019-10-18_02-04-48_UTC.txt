Hey everyone! I’m Haley! I am not a selfie person and certainly not a “no makeup on social media” person, but I had to share these photos because Beautycounter is THIS AMAZING!! I originally tried out Beautycounter for a few reasons (you might have some of the same reasons!!!).
1: I had redness and bumps all over my face. It made makeup look bad and it was uncomfortable.
2: I had dark circles under my eyes (new moms, ya feel me?)
3: I was looking to get into some anti-aging. I have two young girls and they are giving me fine lines (and a few white hairs).
4: I was having intense burning a few times a week from simply washing my face. I would break out in a thick layer of dry skin where the burning sensation was.

ANYWAYS, I tried a few samples given to me and immediately fell in love with the Countermatch line. My redness and bumps started fading in 3 days. THREE DAYS. After a week or so my skin started to glow. Almost a month in and my dark circles are lightened immensely. Oh, and not once have I had another burning breakout since I started using Beautycounter. I have tried other products and love EVERY SINGLE ONE.

With results like these, how could I not want to share it with my friends and family? The last two pictures are me before using @beautycounter. The first picture is now, completely clean face.
