I hope everyone has had an amazing weekend so far! Weather out in Long Island has been spectacular! We have had boat rides and beach days, and while I am a sun worshiper, it can take a toll on my skin leaving me feeling extra dry and stiff. .

I’m a Countermatch lover because it meets my skin where it’s at. I’m a normal to dry skin type with certain areas dryer than others (like my chin). Countermatch moisturizes and hydrates my skin and never feels oily, greasy, or heavy (especially in all this heat) because it mimics my skin cells. .
