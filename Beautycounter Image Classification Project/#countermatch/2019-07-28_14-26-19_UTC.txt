Or in Beautycounter speak, it’s full-sized products in your hand, in your home, to use for several days.  Sampling is pretty rare in the high-end skincare world, and drop-offs are the most eco-friendly way to test run a new skincare routine.  We’ll drop  off a bag on Monday, pick it up on Friday, and make note of your “gotta haves” or “think I’ll pass”.
