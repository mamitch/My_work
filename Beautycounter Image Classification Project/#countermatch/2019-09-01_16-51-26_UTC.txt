I use the Countermatch Collection (serum, eye cream and daily moisturizer) plus the No. 1 Brightening Facial Oil. I love how this set adapts to the needs of my skin so it never feels oily or dry! ▪️
Even though I have a very busy son, I still manage to put a little makeup on because of the Flawless in 5 set. This set includes 6 products and takes only 5 minutes to apply. What does it include?
💥 Dew Skin Tinted Moisturizer with SPF 20 (or Tint Skin Hydrating Foundation)
💥Concealer Pen
💥Mascara (Lengthening or Volumizing)
💥Lip Gloss (12 colours to choose from)
💥 Brilliant Brow Gel (or Pencil)
💥Satin Powder Blush (7 colours to choose from)

It’s the perfect time to try some of these products because if you spend $175 (and yes, that includes any of the Last Chance Sale items), you get the Citrus Mimosa Body Butter (value $46).
