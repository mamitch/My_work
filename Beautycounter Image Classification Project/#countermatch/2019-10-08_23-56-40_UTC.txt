Pro-Tip Tuesday! These two products are my go-to for healing a new tattoo 🙌🏼🌸
.
Countermatch Body Lotion has no “fragrance” in it that might be irritating to your skin and provides the perfect amount of moisture no matter your skin type as it adjusts to give you the right each time you use it 🧴
.
Lotus Glow Cleansing Balm is good for SO many things, but I apply this after the lotion to give extra hydration for the healing process. A little goes a long way so this huge jar will probably last me almost a year! We have an even bigger size just for the holidays now too! Go big or go home, right??

Link in bio to grab these items and your tattoo will look amazing for years! .
