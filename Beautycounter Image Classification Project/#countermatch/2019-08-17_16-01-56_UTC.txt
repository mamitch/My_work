Before beautycounter I didn’t have a clue what I was putting on my skin, and I honestly didn’t care. It never occurred to me that the products I was using every single day were toxic and harmful to my skin and health. When I first heard of beautycounter, I’m not going to lie, I was skeptical. I didn’t think it would work. I thought it was a scheme. I thought people were crazy to “sell” products. 
Then I started looking into it. I started reading what beautycounter was all about and reviews people had written. I started researching what was actually in the products I was using. I looked at the list of ingredients that are never used in beautycounters products and compared them to what I was using at the time, and that’s when it hit me. 
There are so many hidden, toxic chemicals in the products on the market today and most people have no clue about them. Most people (including myself) just assume that the FDA wouldn’t let harmful/toxic products, that are used on our skin daily, be put on the market for everyone to use if they weren’t safe. The truth is, the cosmetic industry is hardly regulated at all, but beautycounter not only changed the way they look at cosmetics and skin care, but they are actively working with congress to change the industry as a whole. 
Beautycounter is more than a direct sales company. It’s not only about selling products, but more about educating your friends and family about what’s in their beauty and skin care regimens. Sure, the extra money is nice (I mean, who doesn’t want some extra cash, right?), but more importantly, after researching and seeing how poorly the cosmetic industry is regulated I couldn’t stand by and not share with my family and friends this better beauty mission! 
This is one of the best decisions I’ve made and I am so glad I am apart of this group of women who strive to help make other women (and men 😉) more aware of what they are using on their skin everyday! 
If you want to help share this with me please message me! I would love to help you get started! ♥️
