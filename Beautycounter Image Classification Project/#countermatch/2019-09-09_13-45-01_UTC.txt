No make up Monday. -

I can honestly say that my skin has never looked so even, and irritation free. I’m seriously amazed at the reduced redness & splotchiness, along with the diminishing signs of broken blood vessels (aaaamennnn) -

Stop scrubbing your face with harsh irritants and making it stiff and dry as a bone. There are safe products that get you the texture and appearance you’re looking for WITHOUT harm done to your biological system. -

Switching to safer has me more confident then ever. Not only with the appearance of my skin, but the downright KNOWLEDGE that comes with making better, informed choices. -
