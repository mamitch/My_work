GOD DOES DELIVER ON HIS PROMISES. 🙌🏻We may have all questioned this the last month as the 90* summer temps stuck around well past their welcome, but PTL fall is finally here in Kentucky. 🍂Morning strolls with all my girls have never been this sweet (and cool)! Happy Saturday, y’all! Hope your weekend is full of chili, hot apple cider, Hocus Pocus on repeat, and pumpkin pecan waffle candles burning! 🕯
