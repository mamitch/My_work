S A M P L E S!💕
In light of October being breast cancer awareness month, I’m thrilled to be sharing these skin care samples that meet the highest safety and health standards. Let’s not celebrate this important month with toxic products that are doing more harm than good.
🌿 There is a lot we don’t know about cancer, but research has linked common ingredients in personal care products to cancer concerns—especially when looking at a long term toxin load. We can do better!

You guys know my one step at a time approach, so today do me a favor—take a look at your feminine care products and next time you run out, grab a better alternative (safer brands at Whole Foods, Target, diva cups, etc are thankfully becoming more accessible.) If you have teen girls this is incredibly important for them too! 💕

💌SAMPLE time: Tag a friend, comment on this photo, and DM me your address if you would like to try one of my two absolute favorite regimens from @beautycounter: Countermatch and Countertime. (Take the skin care quiz on our site if you’re not sure which!) Note: if you shop with another consultant or are a consultant, thanks for understanding this is for others.☺️
