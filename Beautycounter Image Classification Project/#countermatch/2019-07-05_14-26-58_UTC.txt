What's your skin type? Tell me in the comments 💁🏻‍♀️ If you're not sure, go to the link in my bio and take the 1 minute skincare quiz!

There are really 4 skin types: oily, normal, dry, and combination. From there, you might be acne prone, you might have facial hair if you're a man or teen boy, or you may have mature skin. So finding a regimen suited for your particular skin type might seem difficult. 👉🏼 Countercontrol is best suited for oily acne-prone skin whether you're a teen or adult because breakouts happen no matter your age. 👉🏼 Countermatch is good for normal and dry skin types because it's formulated with Bio-mimic technology which delivers the exact amount of moisture your skin needs. 👉🏼 Counterman is perfect for men of all ages whether you've got a beard or bare skin. ⏳  Lastly, mark you calendars for July 9th when our newest skincare line is all about aging well. You'll want to get your hands on it!
