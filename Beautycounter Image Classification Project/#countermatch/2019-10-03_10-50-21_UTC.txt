Good Morning Insta Fam!

I am starting something new called Thursday Thoughts! Every week I’ll bring you some interesting facts or ideas surroundomg beautycounter, safer beauty, and overall health ❤️ On this edition of Thursday Thoughts- I was sharing my favorite eye cream with a friend who was worried about dark circles. I am the 👸🏻 of dark circles even before kids and no sleep and this is by far my favorite product for them! 
I sent her the picture below and her first statement was, “Ummmm you need some more!” I laughed because clearly this bottle is on its last legs but the weird part is, it’s absolutely still full of product!!! Of all the reasons I love beautycounter the strange long lasting aspect of them is one of my Top 5! 
The bottles can look or feel empty but they just keep on going like that energizer bunny. I have been working on this eye cream for at least 4-6 months and every time I think it’s done I push the pump and there’s plenty more 😱  I have no idea how but I don’t care- it makes the expense that much more rewarding knowing I’m paying for safe products for myself that seem to last an eternity! 
Here’s to safer beauty and the long lasting products in the 🌎💫 #saferbeauty #beautycounter #eyeresecuecream #countermatch #eyecream #darkcircles #longlastingcream
