Taking a minute to highlight another business that cares for both beauty and sustainability!
.
BeautyCounter sells makeup and skincare made from clean ingredients that are better for people and the planet. This might sound like an ad, but itâ€™s not. Iâ€™ve genuinely been helped by their products!
.
I had to stop wearing eye makeup due to some chronic eye issues and was super bummed. If I used eye shadow or mascara, Iâ€™d wake up with puffy, red, itchy eyes in the morning (even if I had removed them the night before). It was a bummer to put together a cute outfit and then have to go without makeup!
.
Enter BeautyCounter. My friend @autumnleggett told me about these clean beauty products, helped me choose some colors, and Iâ€™ve been able to resume wearing mascara and eye shadow again with no issues! ðŸ˜±ðŸ¥³ Itâ€™s clear that their products are made from superior stuff, as my body isnâ€™t protesting them!
.
Being a chronic illness patient (aka #spoonie ) means I have lots of weird things going on in my body. I have a condition that causes my body temp to be extra hot and sweat more than the average person (which is just rough during the humid summers here in southeast VA).
.
BeautyCounterâ€™s Countermatch Lotion is the first moisturizer Iâ€™ve ever tried that adds moisture where I need it and actually keeps the other parts of my face from getting shiny! I had given up on having a matte complexion without having to cake on powder - but now I have a great helper in the form of this little bottle.

Iâ€™m not posting this to ask for purchases, just to share about another friendâ€™s small business and the products that have helped me. But if you do make a purchase, know that it comes with a 60 day full refund policy (and a free return shipping label). ðŸ˜‰
.
Yay for businesses like BeautyCounter and Poshmark who are helping us use and re-use beauty & fashion in ways that are sustainable!
