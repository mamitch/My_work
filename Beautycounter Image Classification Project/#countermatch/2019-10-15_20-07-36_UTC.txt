I know you’ve all heard me talk a lot on here about being mindful of how we take care of ourselves.  Everything from the food we put IN our bodies - to the types of products we put ON our bodies.  I wholeheartedly believe that It all matters, and it all adds up ✨
.
It’s been a long process for me - but over the years I’ve been slowly transforming my beauty and skincare routine into one I can feel GOOD about - inside and out.  While I’ve shared with you many of my favorite “clean beauty” products - I am so thrilled to be adding one more to my list, @beautycounter.
.
Just this past month I tried @beautycounter for the very first time.  I’ve always supported their mission to get safer beauty products into the hands of everyone - but this was my first time actually using their products.
.
Today on the blog I’m sharing why I wholeheartedly believe in the @beautycounter mission, what products I’ve tried so far, and my initial reactions to it all.
.
I’d love to hear your thoughts.  What “clean beauty” products do you love?? Are any of you fellow @beautycounter lovers?!! Share in the comments what products I should try next!  Would love to hear your thoughts....😘💕
