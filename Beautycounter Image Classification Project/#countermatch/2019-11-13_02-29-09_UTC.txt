You guys!! I have been getting so many compliments on my skin and BELIEVE ME that never happens, especially as we enter the cold frigid temps of the northeast!! (Can you say dry, flaky, itchy skin is my usual MO?? Anyone else??)

Allow me to introduce you to the nighttime products I cannot live without:
-
💦 Beautycounter Cleansing Balm
💦 Countermatch Pure Calm Cleansing Milk
💦 Countermatch Intense Moisture Serum
💦 Countermatch Recovery Sleeping Cream
💦 Countermatch Eye Rescue Cream
💦 Beautycounter Lip Conditioner

Countermatch products use the unique life-giving properties of plants to match the structure of skin, giving it exactly what it needs and nothing it doesn’t. I love how it makes my skin feel hydrated but never oily. I’ve realized as I’ve gotten older my skin has changed from combination to dry and what it was craving was hydration. This lotion provides just what it needs! 💦
-
Countermatch Adaptive Moisture Lotion from Beautycounter is perfect for all skin types. Using Bio-Mimic Technology, it adjusts hydration levels throughout the day for a smooth look and feel, and a radiant glow.

So I’m just curious, out of the items listed above what would your skin appreciate the MOST?? 👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻
