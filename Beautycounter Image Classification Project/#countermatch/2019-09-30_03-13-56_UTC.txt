I finally did it! I asked on stories a LONG time ago if you guys wanted me to do a nighttime/daytime routine video and everybody that voted said yes! I asked nighttime or daytime routine and nighttime got the majority (barely) so this one came first!! I hope you enjoy it/it‚Äôs helpful! Routine below üëáüèª
Step 1: Cleanse/Exfoliate with Nourishing Cream Cleanser or Exfoliator (I left this out because I did it in the shower so duh)

Step 2: Countertime Essence (toner step)

Step 3: In video I did the Overnight Resurfacing Peel (otherwise skip)

Step 4: 1.5 pumps Countermatch Sleeping Cream and 3 drops No. 3 oil (pic is new packaging) mixed together and applied

Step 5: Countertime Eye Cream

Yes, all the regimens/collections work better together. However, this is what I do for nighttime! Once my sleeping cream is gone I will switch to the Countertime Supreme Cream! However, I LOVE the nourishing cleansers and will stick with those for now! You do you!
