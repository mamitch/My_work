Beautycounter's health and safety standards go beyond what is legally required in the US. Our Never List is made up of more than 1,500 chemicals that we never use as ingredients in our products. The list includes over 1,400 chemicals banned or restricted in personal care products by the European Union, plus addition chemicals that Beautycounter found concerning. We never tests our finished products on animals, and work hard to minimize the potential that a product may even contain a trace level of a chemical from The Never List.
