Most of us have no idea that some of the beauty products on the market today contain harsh chemicals and potentially harmful ingredients.

There are a lot of hidden ingredients in beauty products. Some of the most toxic are: 🌱 Methylparaben is a preservative used in many beauty products ... at least in the U.S. Use of these chemicals is restricted in the European Union because they've been linked to cancer, may disrupt the endocrine system, or be toxic in other ways. The Cosmetics Database labels them a "high hazard."
🌱 Propylparaben is a frequently used cosmetics ingredient that can irritate skin and eyes or cause reactions in those who are allergic. Some studies have also raised concerns about endocrine disruption, cancer and other toxic effects. It is rated a "moderate hazard" by the Cosmetics Database.
🌱 Retinyl Palmitate is a synthetic form of vitamin A that may be toxic to pregnant women. It is rated a "moderate hazard" by the Cosmetics Database because limited evidence links exposure to a range of health problems, from cancer to reproductive effects.
🌱 Colorants, such as D&C Red 36 (rated "low hazard"), and D&C Red 22 🌱 Aluminum Lake (rated "moderate hazard") are typically tested on animals, and have raised concerns because some research has linked exposure to nervous system damage and other health concerns.
🌱 Tocopheryl Acetate, also known as vitamin E acetate, is used in a variety of products, including lipstick, moisturizer and foundation. The Cosmetics Database rates it as a "moderate hazard" because it may cause itching, burning, scaling, hives and skin blistering, and may be toxic.
