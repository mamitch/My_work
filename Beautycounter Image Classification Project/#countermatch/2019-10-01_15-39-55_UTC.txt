October 1st!! Wow.  I have several super exciting announcements this morning! October is a fantastic month to jump in with safer body care/skincare/makeup!  BC is disrupting the personal care industry by utilizing the strictest ingredient selection process, heavy metal testing and safety standards in the industry!  We prohibit over 1500 harmful and questionable ingredients from our formulations without sacrificing performance.  Safe & high-performing?  Yes, please!  Check out what’s happening this month...

❤ First—I have ONE 15% off promo code for any Brand-New-To-Beautycounter client wanting to order a safer skincare collection of your choice!  This is a first-come-first-served basis as I have only one code to share!  So, if you’re new to BC and you’ve had your eye on any of our collections, jump on this offer, it expires October 6!—it’s a very rare opportunity to get a discount on an already discounted collection! Hello, Countertime!!
Clients—do you have any friends who would like to take advantage of this? 
Send them my way!

❤ Second — ANYONE purchasing a skincare collection through 11:59pm October 6 will receive a FREE Overnight Resurfacing Peel ($63 value). This is the BEST booster you can add to any skincare collection (even Men’s!) to amp up the results.

❤ Third — new Band of Beauty members will receive the Charcoal Facial Mask FREE when you add BOB to an order total of $50+. Charcoal Mask is fantastic for detoxing your skin, pulling out impurities and reducing excess oil!  Plus, it has some resurfacing benefits.  My skin feels super smooth after I use it.
