For clearer skin that needs no filter, there's Countercontrol 💁🏻‍♀️ If my face is going to breakout, then I need an arsenal of clean skincare products that will work with my skin and not irritate it. Here's the beauty of a regimen: it's a specific routine of products that target your specific needs 💆🏻‍♀️ And my favorite part is adding in other products like a charcoal mask or facial oil to round out my daily/nightly skincare routine. Check out my story for some ways to add Counter+ to your own routine 🌿 If you need another reason to switch to #saferskincare, remember that you can get our Overnight Resurfacing Peel ($63 value) for free when you pick up a skincare collection! Ends on 10/6 so hurry while supplies last 😉
