‚ÄúWow, you‚Äôre a mom of 3? One being a 2 month old? No way, you look so refreshed!‚Äù .
Ok, so this may or may not be what I whisper to myself every morning while I barely get my teeth brushed in time for drop off! Just because I‚Äôm part of the most amazing #beautyrevolution doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs always perfect! I think people have the assumption that anyone selling skincare, or whatever it is, are just trying to convince you that it‚Äôs the BEST and it‚Äôs a MIRACLE!! Well, not this girl! Real life is - I‚Äôm no dermatologist and I‚Äôm not watching everything you do, I don‚Äôt know what you ingest, eat, drink and apply. Those things play a part in all of this! What I do know, is there has been NO regulation in the personal care industry since 1938 ü§Ø as in, no one gives a crap about what companies put in your products! What I do know is there is proof that the ingredients these companies use are HARMFUL to us! And @beautycounter has taken it upon themselves to invest tons of money and time to be sure they offer you the #cleanest most #highperforming beautiful, sexy products out there! 
Guess what there is no miracle, right down to a head transplant, that can get rid of pimples, wrinkles, etc. This is life, you will age - embrace it! Do it beautifully. And age with confidence, knowing you only put #safe products on and in your bodies! .
And yes sweet whispers of lies & wishful thinking will get you through also!
