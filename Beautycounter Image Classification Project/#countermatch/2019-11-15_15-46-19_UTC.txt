#thankfulfaces Day 15: Coffee. Today’s mood brought to you by caffeine and #countermatch plus #dewskintintedmoisturizer and my personal shade of pink thanks to the #transforminglipduo ▪️
I’m thankful that every day when I wake up my husband has started a pot of coffee for us. I’m thankful that I typically get a few hot sips in before the babes demand my attention (mommas...tell me there’ll be a day when that whole cup will be warm when I drink it 🤞🙏). I’m thankful that most days the babes sleep well and my morning cup is not a necessity...just part of my routine (a wise woman once told me it’s better if your coffee is just part or your routine and not something you need). ▪️
Coffee drinkers...is your cup part of your morning routine or a necessity? And if you’re not a coffee drinker, what helps you start your day off on the right foot?
