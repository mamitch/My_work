Just a little peek at my favorite way to do a spa night at home. I try to do this at least once a week. Not only does it make my skin feel amazing, but it’s also great to take this extra time to treat myself and step away from all the chores at home for a few minutes. Swipe to see the charcoal mask before and after (I always love the way my skin looks and feels after the mask!), plus my spa night product line up.
