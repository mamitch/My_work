Tint Skin is the best foundation for a natural-look! I use the (morphe) blending brush to apply which makes it go on effortlessly. The light-medium coverage makes it easy for your face to breathe so you don’t feel super hot after putting on makeup. I don’t know about you, but that was the worst part of putting on make-up on hot summer days, but not anymore thanks to Tint Skin!! 👏🏻🥳 If you want some at a discount order before the 12th for 15% off and make sure to choose friends and family social at checkout 🥰
