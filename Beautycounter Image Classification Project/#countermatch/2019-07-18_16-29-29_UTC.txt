🎉🎉Happy skin, social mission, and free stuff? 🙋‍♀️🙋‍♀️🙋‍♀️
.
Another great opportunity to hop on my Beautycounter team, whether you just want a heavy discount on safer, high-performing  products for your family or you want a rewarding side hustle...
.
In an effort to move to GLASS, for a limited time, they are offering packages of current favorites products at a very desirable discount (~44% off) and will send you the updated products for FREE when they launch in a few weeks.
.
The quick version of this story: you'll get double of some of your favorite products for substantially less than you can buy them on a regular day.
.
(Then you can even purchase the new Countertime line - or anything else you love -  for 25% off.) 😍
.
I'm happy to send a few more details if you would like to learn more with zero obligation.
.
Just send me a 🙋‍♀️ or an 👂...
.
💜 Meg
