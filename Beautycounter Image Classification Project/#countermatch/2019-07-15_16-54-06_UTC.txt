It took me yearssss & the help of my at-the-time #Beautycounter rep to help me to understand that adding moisture to your face is N E E D E D and will not make you break-out.
—
It’s the L A C K of moisture.

Your skin will actually overcompensate if you don’t moisturize. Your skin will produce too much oil to make-up for it, and then it goes downhill from there.
—
Too oily in the wrong spots ▶️ breakouts
Too dry in other spots ▶️ fine lines, wrinkles
And, why not take it next-level, do you skin (& your future) a solid and invest in S A F E?
