Nighttime is the right time to revive skin with our Countermatch Recovery Sleeping Cream.

This advanced blend of hyaluronic acid, plum oil, and tara gum creates a protective layer to help replenish hydration and revitalize skin while you sleepâ€”so skin looks youthfully smoother, softer, and more radiant in the morning. Breakthrough Bio-Mimic Technology harnesses the unique life-giving properties of plants to match the composition of skin, giving it precisely what it needs and nothing it doesn't.
