This is one of my favs to use in the morning! Between a full time mom and working a full time just (with lots of overtime at the moment) and trying to run a household, my eyes stay puffy from exhaustion. A little dab of our eye rescue cream and I look way better than I feel haha! It at least gives my eyes a pick me up and helps me pretend I have it all together, even if I barely brushed my hair while running out the door! ðŸ˜‚ we all have those days.... ++++
Also, if you have more mature skin ask me about our countertime eye cream!
