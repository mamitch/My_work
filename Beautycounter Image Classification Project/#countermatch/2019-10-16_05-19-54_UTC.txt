Selecting high quality skin care products that do not contribute to our overwhelming toxic load can feel daunting. doTERRA and Beautycounter both make quality products you can trust.  My morning skin care routine includes: Beautycounter Nourishing Rosewater Mist, Countermatch Intense Moisture Serum and Adaptive Moisture Lotion and doTERRA Essential Skin Care Eye Cream. My evening skin care routine includes: Mountain Rose Herbs Jojoba Oil, doTERRA Lavender and Yarrow Pom.  Yarrow Pom is revitalizing leaving you with glowing and healthy skin. Lavender is calming and soothing with the added benefit of promoting collagen synthesis. Jojoba is a wonderful carrier oil for the face as it most closely resembles your natural skin sebum.
