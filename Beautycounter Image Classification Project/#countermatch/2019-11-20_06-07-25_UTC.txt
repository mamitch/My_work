So freaking tired. Worked a crazy 2 days, living the #urgentcare life during cold and flu and RSV season. If you come see me..you will likely be swabbed ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ #Strep #Flu #RSV #ViralPanels ? ??? I digress. My skin after a 13.5 hour shift is so good! Because prevention is key! Beautycounter has something for ANYONE in your life. And we can all use pampering. #selfcare #skincare #Countertime #serums #UnderEyeCream #countermatch  #beTheChange
