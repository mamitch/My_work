I’m so excited that my package’s arrived today! It’s even #nationalrelaxationday and what better way to relax than with new #makeup from @beautycounter and from @iliabeauty I’m trying out a new mascara from a recommendation @megsphatlife she’s full of awesomeness so I’m sure I will love this natural mascara! I have been wanting to try beauty counter’s tinted dew skin foundation forever and finally bought myself it as well as the #countermatch line these are all new items for me that I’m excited to try. I have been loving lip gloss lately for days that I can’t put anything on my face due to #pain I dab a little gloss on and it makes me feel a little better about myself so I got their #rosewood color and #azalea color for a fun splash! I can’t wait to test everything out! #beautycounter #betterbeauty #beautyshouldbegoodforyou #switchtosafer #naturalmakeup #makeupoftheday #skincare #skincareproduct #saferbeauty #lipgloss #foundation #moisturizer #theneverlist #ewg #cosmetics #unparalleledsafety #happy #playtime #saferskincareforeveryone #trigeminalneuralgia #chronicpain #invisiblesillness #treatyourskin
