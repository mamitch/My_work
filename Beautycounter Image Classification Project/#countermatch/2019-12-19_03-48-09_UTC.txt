I’m so excited to try the @beautycounter #countermatchcollection tonight!!! I just received it in the mail and one thing I noticed right off is the packaging. Beautycounter has the most incredible packaging. It feels very high end. But this! THIS!! It feels mechanically modern (is that a thing?!?) and looks like like you can’t even afford it! As time goes, I’ll be writing up posts on my blog, reviews, ingredient explanation, and so on. I can’t wait to tell you all about it! .
