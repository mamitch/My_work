The countermatch line, is what I’m trying next. This is a process of finding the best match for your skin. A little or this and a little of that. I plan to return the products that haven’t worked well for me, but it takes a few weeks of consistency to really know. Countermatch is designed with bio-mimicking technology, that matches the composition of your skin. This allows the products to give skin precisely what it needs and nothing it doesn’t. Perfect for aging prevention, normal, dry or combination skin. I’ll keep you updated on how I like the products! #adultacne #hormonalacne #beautycounter #countermatch #workinprogress #skintervention
