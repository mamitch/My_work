Product Tip Thursday !!
The importance of using a MOISTURIZER
🍂🍁 - Using a daily moisturizer can help prevent and treat skin concerns regardless of your skin type (it even helps balancing oily skin) - The moisturizer protects sensitive skin - - - Improves your overall texture and skin tone while masking the imperfections. - It seals in natural water produced by your skin. - It protects the outer layer of the skin from the environment such as wind, sun ( still needs SPF, as well ) and all the other environmental pollutants.

WHAT KIND OF MOISTURIZER DO I USE?
🍂🍁
It is very important to use a moisturizer that suits your skin type and needs. Beautycounter has a great selection that covers all that I mentioned above. 🍂🍁
It is important to use a moisturizer right after cleaning the face or bathing the body as the skin is still damp.Remember that hot water can strip oil and natural water out of the skin so be sure to apply moisturizer to replenish what may have been lost during the cleansing process. 🍂🍁 MOISTURIZING = SKIN PRESERVATION 🍂🍁
The skin on your face, ears, neck and chest are highly susceptible to environmental changes and have a higher probability of developing skin conditions.  These areas also shed cells faster than any other parts of the body,  therefore there is a greater need for moisture to repair itself. Also, the massaging that occurs when applying with your moisturizer can help stimulate blood circulation and new cell regeneration. 🍂🍁
MOISTURIZING REDUCES SKIN PROBLEMS 🍂🍁
Moisturizing daily can actually camouflage skin blemishes. It leaves the skin supple, healthy and smooth. Use Dew Skin with your daily routine to give it a tint effect 👌
FALL is windy, so Happy Moisturizing 😘!!!
