Let’s talk about safety! 
Beautycounter tests their products 3 times for safety before it’s made available to the public. A lot of companies claim to be safe, but unfortunately they still use some of the toxic ingredients that have been linked to cancer. 
It’s always Important to check your labels for toxic ingredients and make sure you know what you are putting on your skin! If you’re unsure which ingredients to look for, check out our never list. There are over 1,500 chemicals that we never use in our products!
