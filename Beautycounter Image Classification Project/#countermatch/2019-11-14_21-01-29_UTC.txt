Last night I got to share my passion of #Beautycounter, #betterbeauty and #saferbeauty.  I love sharing with others the benefits of switching to safer products. 
Knowledge is power, and a lot of people don’t know that the products they’re using contain harmful ingredients. When I first learned that Europe bans 1,400 ingredients while the U.S. only bans 30, it lit a fire in my soul. I was shocked at the lack of regulation in the United States versus in the European Union and the fact that no new law had been passed since 1938.

In the past skin care was always a challenge for me.  Finding the right product that wouldn’t put me into a break out pattern, dealing with sensitive skin and acne.  Once I started using #Countermatch and most recently #Countertime, the only time my skin breaks out is when I eat sugar…ya ya my body is telling me something for sure! Stop the madness and don’t eat that!

Whether you are looking to switch to a safer skin care regimen, for that perfect foundation, host a social or an opportunity to build a business, be your own boss and earn some extra cash, DM me now!
