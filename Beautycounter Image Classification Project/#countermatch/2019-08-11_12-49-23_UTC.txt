I remember feeling very overwhelmed by the idea of switching to cleaner products...Where do I start? —
It didn’t feel financially sound to overhaul EVERYTHING at once, so l converted little by little to get the nasties out of my daily personal care routine and reduce my toxic load. —
My advice:
✅start with items that cover your whole body (think Body lotion 🧴)
✅or stay on your skin all day/night ( Foundation/ Overnight treatments/facial oils)
—
So here’s my personal list of starter products: (ALL of which are on sale but only through Monday night.)
1️⃣Countermatch Adaptive Body Moisturizer 
2️⃣Countermatch Adaptive Moisture lotion (face)
3️⃣Tint Skin (foundation)
4️⃣Dew Skin (tinted moisturizer w spf)
5️⃣Brightening + Vit C Facial oil
6️⃣Overnight Resurfacing Peel 🙌🏼
7️⃣Balancing Charcoal Face Mask
8️⃣Countersun Tinted mineral sunscreen 🧴 (All can be ordered through the link in my bio)

With @beautycounter I don’t have to scour ingredient lists unless I want to because every ingredient is chosen for safety and effectiveness...but you can still check them out on EWG skin deep!
