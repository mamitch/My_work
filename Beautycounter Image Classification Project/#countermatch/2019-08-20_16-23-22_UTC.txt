Dry skin here! 🙋🏻‍♀️ I've always struggled with dry, thirsty and flaky skin since I was a preteen. I tried A L L the intense moisture creams and moisturizers that I could find on the shelves at target and Walmart. Some worked temporarily but would usually always have a side effect whether it be redness or rash, others just clogged my pores. 😟

Enter @beautycounter's Nourishing Face Collection in September 2015. I finally understood the power of a face regimen AND quality ingredients. Needless to say, it's been a WIN! - 
I have since tried the Countermatch and Countertime collections and LOVE them both, but I've gotta say- I'm falling fast in love with Countertime. -
The power of a regimen is REAL, y'all! Especially for those of you 25+ in age. You only have one chance to age, why not gracefully? Using a hodgepodge of products from the shelves of a drugstore can truly be frustrating and frankly defeating. I cannot tell you how much $$ I wasted on "sampling" each brand to no avail. -
