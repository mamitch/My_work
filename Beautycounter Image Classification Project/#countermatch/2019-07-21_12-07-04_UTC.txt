There are so many reasons that I love #beautycounter. The incredible products, their mission to change the beauty industry as well as the environment, I could go on and on... This morning I am reminded of another reason I love Beautycounter.  These products and this business have given me confidence!  Not only in my apparence, but in my ability to try new things and to put myself out there. 
Beautycounter has had a profound impact on my life and I'm thrilled to see where this new found confidence will take me!
