Honestly true........Beautycounter has helped me look and feel so much better about myself! I used to struggle with really rosy cheeks, dark dark circles under my eyes and getting constant blemishes. Since I started using Beautycounter the redness in my cheeks has diminished, my eyes are less puffy and I look like I actually slept and I honestly canâ€™t remember the last time I had a bad pimple. This stuff works people!!! Message me if you want to learn more or want me to suggest some products for you ðŸ’•#saferbeauty #peel #eyecream #countercontrol #countermatch #beautycounter
