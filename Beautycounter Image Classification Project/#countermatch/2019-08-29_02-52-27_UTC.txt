Confession time - for a long time I spent a whole lot of time making sure I was eating healthy foods and getting all the nutrients my body needed, but still using conventional make up and skin care products. I knew what I was putting in my body was really powerful for my health, but I wasn’t paying any attention to what I was putting on my body. 
When a friend of mine, shared what she knew and gave me some safer products for my baby 👶🏼 I suddenly started to care a lot more about what potential dangers were lurking in the products. 
It’s true when people say ignorance is bliss. It was so shocking to learn how many harmful ingredients are in these products. And what’s even worse is the little to no government regulation. 
According to the Environmental working group, the average woman 👩 uses 12 products containing 168 unique ingredients every single day. Most contain endocrine disrupters, which can affect hormonal balance and fertility. Some contain ingredients with clear links to cancer. We happily put this stuff on our faces, our bodies, our children’s bodies. 
After doing my own research and learning more about this I knew I couldn’t keep using these products. And I believe more women should have this information too. 
There is almost zero federal regulation of the cosmetic industry in the U.S. This means there’s basically no way to be sure if a product is safe before it’s sold, and no way to get unsafe products off the shelves. 
Even if something is labeled “natural” they aren’t regulated. “natural” products contain just as many harmful ingredients as conventional products. Products labeled “unscented” can contain fragrances.  Many “natural” brands contain toxic heavy metals like aluminum, cadmium, lead, mercury, and arsenic. These can be inhaled, ingested and absorbed in the body overtime and become a serious threat to the health of your body and brain. 
Because of the little to no regulation of these harmful ingredients in personal care, it is up to us to choose safer products for ourselves and our families.
