Beautycounter has been such a game-changer for my skin! Can’t say enough about how impressed I’ve been with these products, ever since I began using them. I’m finally taking back control of my neglected skin. I’ve always struggled with having oily skin, redness & big pores. Being hot natured, my makeup would look good until about lunchtime, then the oil slick returned & makeup would slowly start sliding off. •
Now, I stay shine free, pretty much the entire day! I think my skin is a little lighter, clearer, healthier & kinda glowy, but in a good way! No need for blotting or touch-up’s anymore, thanks to the Countercontrol line and even the nighttime routine helps! I’ve been using the cleansing balm & overnight resurfacing peel. Love it all! •
