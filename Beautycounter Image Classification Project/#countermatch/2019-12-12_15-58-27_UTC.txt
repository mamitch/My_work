WHATS YOUR FAVORITE SKINCARE/MAKEUP products? 
I’m a beauty counter gal. Took me about 2 years to convert over. But my skin is pretty sensitive after switching over to #countermatch adaptive moisturizer my skin glows and stays hydrated. My favorite part though about @beautycounter is the makeup. This eyeshadow palette is perfect. Got it last year and it’s become my go to palette. At first I wasn’t a fan of the dewy skin tint moisturizer but I recently went back to my bare minerals tint skin and what a difference my skin started to break out! So back to dewy skin and loving it.
