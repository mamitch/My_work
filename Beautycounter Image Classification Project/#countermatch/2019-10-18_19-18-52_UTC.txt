Winter is coming and you know what that means?! DRY skin 😢 I recently starting using this after my legs were so itchy and I had tried so many things my dermatologist recommended and they didn’t work. This worked instantly!! It is called an adaptive body lotion because it ADAPTS to your skin!! So as SUMMER turns to FALL and FALL turns to WINTER... this countermatch adaptive body lotion from @beautycounter should be your go to!! 🙌🏻❤️
