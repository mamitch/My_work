An endocrine disruptor is any chemical that can interfere with normal hormone functions. Most endocrine-disrupting compounds come from synthetic chemicals and can be avoided. These chemicals can imitate hormones and destroy others while creating internal signaling issues which causes premature cell death. Endocrine disruptors have also been proven to accumulate in hormone-producing organs, resulting in organ malfunctions and irreversible damage.

Beauty’s most common Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals are 🌱 Parabens - chemicals with estrogen-like properties, and estrogen abnormalities are involved in the development of breast cancer.
🌱 Phthalates - studies have shown adverse effects on the male reproductive system, including decreased sperm count, testicular cell destruction and thyroid irregularities.

Look for beauty products without synthetic fragrance 🌱“Fragrance” or “pafum” could be the most vaguely listed ingredients in existence. Because fragrance is considered “proprietary,” companies are not required to disclose its components. This is where ingredients, like phthalates, can unknowingly make their way into your products.
