My skin has been feeling a bit dryer than usual lately so Trying to up my water intake during this busy season AND switched to our #countermatch collection for a few days (other than usual #Countertime). This am I washed with our charcoal bar; followed by Countermatch Serum; then Adaptive Moisture Lotion; and Brow Gel in Light. No need (or time!) for anything else! And just for some pre-shopping fun, lip gloss in Cranberry Shimmer; Hannah In Amber Shimmer ðŸ‘„ #blackFriday #sale #beautycounter #pensacolamoms #taosmoms
