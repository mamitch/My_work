SAFER beauty.  PSA: this photo hasn't been edited, retouched, whatever. .
Being a huge part of the facial paralysis world,  I have also become very self conscious over what I put on my face.  I've worked hard for that crooked smile and dimple you can see from space so I'm cautious as to what I smear all over it.  Not to.mention I'm also 45 years old , so I'm now at the age that I dont have that "spring back" in my skin.
.
Enter stage left @beautycounter products.  I've been using them for a little while now but I'm one of those I have to drive something a while before I decide if it's for me. .
#adultacne  Yep it's a thangggg and it's annoying.  I havent had any breakouts since I've been using #beautycounter. .
#eyewrinkles They have drastically improved. They got worse after I used a nationally recognized leading eye cream.  Go figure...its me. But the eye serum has been the #bomb!
.
#hydratedandsoft I have the worst dry skin you'll ever see. My skin literally flakes when the seasons change and I use enough lotion to bath 12 elephants.  Since I switched to their moisturizer and oil, no flakes and I've even been asked by my aesthetician if I've been drinking more water.  Nope just better and safer skincare products. .
#saferbeauty Plus all their products have been run through the ringer, tested and 1,500 chemicals usually used in beauty products, theyve made sure those havent gotten in.  Can we hear a #hallelujah?!?
.
Again I'm 45 years old and my skin looks more bright and healthy in this photo than it has since I was probably a teenager. .
So if you're looking for a new skincare line and gift ideas for hubby for the holidays, I got ya boo. ;)
