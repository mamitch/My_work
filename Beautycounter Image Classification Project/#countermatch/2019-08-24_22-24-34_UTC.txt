🗣Where are all my combination skin girls at? 🙋🏼‍♀️

I’m right there with ya. My skin hates anything with too much oil it in, and I was really apprehensive to try this line because it didn’t say ‘oil-free’. Usually I get nice, big, cystic bumps if I use too heavy of a moisturizer. I am happy to report that this line lives up to the hype. I’m hydrated and blemish free!
