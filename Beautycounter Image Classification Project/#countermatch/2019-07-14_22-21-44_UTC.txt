The mission is simple: to get safer products into the hands of everyone. Today, our beauty industry has VERY little regulation. The last time Congress passed a law, regulating the industry was in 1938!!!!!!! 81 years ago! ðŸ˜³ Europe bans 1400 harmful ingredients. You know how many the US bans? Only 11. Thatâ€™s right, ELEVEN. This makes me SO mad!!! â€¢

Beautycounterâ€™s goal is to create & distribute safe, high performing products; educate the public on how to avoid harmful ingredients & urge the government to pass laws to better regulate the beauty industry. â€¢

If this interests you or fires you up as much as it did me, please DM me, so I can hook you up with some safer, better products to try!!
