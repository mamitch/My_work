I started using nontoxic skincare and makeup consistently when I developed a paraben allergy. I do my best to eat minimally processed foods so it’s no surprise that I care about skincare/makeup products too. especially when my face rejects the toxic ones. I’ve been using @beautycounter for ~2 years now and my skin has never been so clear and consistent. they ban 1500+ ingredients sadly found in many drugstore beauty products. @beautycounter is always working to raise the #betterbeauty bar. I promise you this isn’t about selling or promoting. it’s about educating people on safe, nontoxic products #honesttruth✌🏼which leads me to share a little love with you: now through Friday 9/27, get a FREE retractable foundation brush with the purchase of any Flawless in Five customizable makeup kit💃🏻swipe to see some my fave products👉🏼and DM me for more details, questions, ways to save even more (AKA Amazon Prime for Beautycounter)
