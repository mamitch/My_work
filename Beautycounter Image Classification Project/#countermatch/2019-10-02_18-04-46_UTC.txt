Howdy and Happy HumpDay! Just giving a little shout out to a new promotion from my beloved BC. 
Going on now through October 6th, if you purchase ANY of our skin-care collections you will receive a FREE Overnight Resurfacing peel. This peel is normally $63 all on its own, so this is an amazing offer- it's a real glow getter ðŸ¤©

ALSO!!! A super special promotion being offered from my #betterbeauty team is that for every order placed at Beautycounter (now through October 15th), $1 will be donated to Breast Cancer Prevention Partners in honor of Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Last year we were able to raise and donate over $600 just from our team! Clean beauty with an important cause to boot. Win-win in my book. Thank you for being a part of our movement for better health and wellness.

A link to my shop is in my bio. I'm happy to answer any questions on the skin-care collections, too!
