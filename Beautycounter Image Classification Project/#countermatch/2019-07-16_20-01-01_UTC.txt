Are you looking for safer skin care but not sure where to begin?  Beautycounter has three amazing skin care collections.  All three collections are high performing and safer for you!  We have a “Never List” of over 1500 ingredients that you will never find in our products.  Unfortunately right now the US has only banned or restricted 30 ingredients from personal care products so Beautycounter has taken it a step further to remove potentially harmful ingredients from our products.

If you are ready to make the switch but not sure which collection or product would be best for your skin type, let me know!  If you are local, I will be hosting a pop up on the 30th where you can try out the products for yourself.  Not in the Charleston area?  That’s ok!  I can always send you samples of these collections for you to try out.  Also, don’t forget that @Beautycounter has a 60 day, no questions asked, return policy so if you are not satisfied with your products, you can return them for a full refund!  I would love to help you find the right products for you.
