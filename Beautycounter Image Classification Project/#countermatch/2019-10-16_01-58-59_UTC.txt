Just did my first live @beautycounter #cleanswap pop-up in my Facebook group and didnâ€™t throw up. #winning I did stumble over my words 100x due to nerves, it was all over the place, and dropped my phone 3 times I think. But HEY I ripped the bandaid off and did it. Out of my comfort zone and feels so great on the other side. Why was I even fearful? Why was I worried? It was so fun! Okay. Now for bed. To the gals that supported me and tuned in, thank you from the bottom of my heart. ðŸ’–
