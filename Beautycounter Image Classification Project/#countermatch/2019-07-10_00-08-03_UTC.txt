My why. 
Harmful chemicals are everywhere and they’re affecting our health more than we realize. A year and a half ago, I started on a mission to upgrade all of the products in our lives to the safest version I could find. From our food to our cleaning products to our skincare and personal hygiene products. That’s where #beautycounter came in. 
I had heard about the products and started to do my own research. Then my girlfriend started selling it and I purchased the #countermatch set. I fell in LOVE. I stopped wearing makeup because my skin looked so good. Meanwhile, my husband was complimenting the makeup he thought I was wearing 😝 
Then somehow, the girl who has no free time decided she wanted everyone to know about it. 🤷‍♀️ So between my big girl job and my babies, I’m going to share it with you.
