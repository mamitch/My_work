Meet my bff of skincare. The Countermatch Adaptive Moisture Lotion is the BEST everyday moisturizer I’ve ever tried (and I’ve tried a lot 😅). Need more convincing? It was awarded by Women’s Health as the best moisturizer for  combination skin in 2019! 
It’s the perfect balance of lightweight and hydrating. It gives your skin moisture in the areas you need it and will adapt all. day. long. to keep your skin hydrated 24/7. This is the perfect addition for the girl who has 7 steps in her routine or the girl who just washes her face with water. 🤷🏻‍♀️ #countermatch #beautycounter #everydaymoisturizer #skincare #cleanbeauty
