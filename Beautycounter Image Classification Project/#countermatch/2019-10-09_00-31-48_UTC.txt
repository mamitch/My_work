October is always flooded with all things pink. And I always share how my grandmother passed away when I was 7 of breast cancer. So this year I’m sharing TIPS!
✨Knowledge is power: check your ingredients and know what your putting on your skin!
✨Cook carefully! Um, I had no idea that nonstick pans could be coated with toxic chemicals???
✨Check yourself. This is huge and important. 1/4 women that end up with cancer find a lump and detect it earlier than they would without checking.
✨TAKE ACTION! Text BETTEREAUTY to 52886 to join our advocacy for CLEAN and SAFE products for everyone... because that’s not a thing as of now if you didn’t know.
